1. Of forgiveneſſe of Sin.

    _ CHAP. I. An Introduction to the whole.

    _ CHAP. II. The various phraſes whereby Gods forgiving ſinne, and his not forgiving ſinne are intimated and expreſſed in Scripture, which ſaid phraſes of both kindes are ſorted into Negative and Affirmative.

    _ CHAP. III Reaſons and Grounds for the ſaid variety of phraſe, or various expreſſions, together with rules for a right underſtanding and due interpretation of them.

    _ CHAP. IV. What forgiveneſs of ſin is not, laid down in four negative Propoſitions.

    _ CHAP. V. What forgiveneſſe of ſinne is, laid downe in two Affirmative propoſitions, together with the explication of them.

    _ CHAP. VI. The various ſenſes or ſignifications wherein forgiveneſſe of ſin is taken in Scripture, it being taken in four ſeveral ſenſes, but moſt commonly and ſignally in one ſenſe; and what ſenſe that is, declared.

    _ CHAP. VII. That a Reprobate may be ſaid in ſome ſenſe, even in a Scripture ſenſe to be pardoned, and how?

    _ CHAP. VIII. That a ſinner, notwithſtanding his pardon (upon the main) may and oft times doth ſuffer temporal puniſhments for his ſins, together with an Anſwer to ſeveral Objections, wherein the diſtinction betwixt chaſtiſements and puniſhments is examined, and how far forth allowable, declared; wherein alſo the true differences betwixt the ſufferings of the Godly and the wicked are aſſerted and proved, and the falſe ones, (commonly aſſigned) are rejected and refuted. That the Saints may and oft-times do in this life ſuffer for their ſins, Chriſts ſatisfaction notwithſtanding, proved and cleered. In what
ſenſe God doth, and in what ſenſe he doth not remember the ſins of Believers, laid downe in ſundry Propoſitions, Affirmative and Negative; wherein likewiſe is declared, what difference there is betwixt Gods remembring the ſins of the Godly and of the wicked, as alſo betwixt his remembring the ſins of Believers under the Old Teſtament, and the ſins of Believers under the New Teſtament.

    _ CHAP. IX. Caution given as touching the interpretation of ſuch Metaphoricall phraſes, whereby forgiveneſſe of ſinne is expreſſed, that we conſtrue them warily, and in a ſober ſenſe.

    _ CHAP. X. In what ſenſe, or how farre forth as true and falſe, thoſe common ſayings of our Divines [Sublatâ culpâ tollitur poena, & juſtificatio tollit omnia poenalia] may or are to be construed and interpreted, and in what ſenſe to be rejected.

    _ CHAP. XI. That there is no ſuch thing as Remiſſio culpae, [remiſsion of the fault] in way of distinction from Remiſſio poenae [remiſsion of the puniſhment] theſe two being one, and the ſelfe ſame thing. The four following Chapters do declare, that forgiveneſſe of ſin is a dividual, and not an individual action, as is commonly ſuppoſed.

    _ CHAP. XII. That the distinction of the pardon of ſinne, into totall, or partiall; perfect or imperfect, is a juſtifiable diſtinction.

    _ CHAP. XIII. That one and the ſame ſinne may be more or leſſe pardoned.

    _ CHAP. XIIII. That no ſinner is fully pardoned in this life, nor yet afore the day of judgment.

    _ CHAP. XV. The difference betwixt remiſſion of ſinne and Sanctification, commonly aſsigned (that being ſaid to be perfect in this life, this imperfect) rejected and refuted.

    _ CHAP. XVI. That remiſsion of ſinne doth imply ſomewhat poſitive, as well as privative, and for that reaſon, that it differs not from Juſtification, as hath beene by ſome ſuppoſed.

    _ CHAP. XVII. That one and the ſame ſinne may be ſaid, and that in a Scripture ſenſe, to be pardoned, and not pardoned; to be imputed, and not imputed to a ſinner.

    _ CHAP. XVIII. The neceſſity for believers themſelves to pray daily for pardon (according to the tenour of the fifth Petition in the Lords Prayer) aſſerted and evinced, as well by Argument as Anſwer to an Objection; it being withall more at large, and diſtinctly declared, what are the particular things which a believer (according to the tenour of that Petition) is to pray for.

    _ CHAP. XIX. An anſwer to the three following questions. 1. Doth God alwaies pardon a ſinner instantly upon the confeſſion of his ſinnes? 2. In what ſenſe, or how farre forth doth a ſinner receive a preſent pardon, immediately upon the confeſſion of his ſinnes? 3. Whether a truly penitent and believing ſinner having once confeſſed a ſinne, is at any time thereafter to confeſſe it in order to forgiveneſſe? The affirmative to which laſt question, is aſſerted and proved. Certaine particulars added as Cautions for the preventing of mistakes, and
for the better underſtanding of the Authours true ſenſe and meaning.

    _ CHAP. XX. That all ſins, paſt, preſent, or to come, are not at once actually pardoned. That no ſin is from eternity actually pardoned. An Objection anſwered That no ſin is actually pardoned, till the ſinner be in a capacity of receiving or enjoying it. What thoſe things are which do put a ſinner into a capacity of actual pardon, declared in their particulars; together with Reaſons for the remarkableneſſe of the ſame. An Objection anſwered; with a vindicating of that aſſertion in Rom. 4.17. wherein God is ſaid, to call the things that are not, as though
they were, from Antinomian purpoſes.

    _ CHAP. XXI. Caution given as touching a right underſtanding of the two following Propoſitions; laid down by that very learned and pious Divine, Mr. Anthony Burges, in his Sermons concerning Juſtification; viz. 1. No wicked man ever hath any ſin forgiven him. p. 22. 2. It is one thing for God to forgive, and another thing for God not to demand and exact puniſhments. p. 143.

    _ CHAP. XXII. That forgiveneſs of ſin is a Tranſient, and not an Immanent Act in God, proved and cleared. Several Deſcriptions of Actions Immanent and Tranſient ſet downe. Mr. Baxter vindicated in a paſſage about this diſtinction, wherein
Mr. Kendal, hath (as the Author thinks) cauſeleſly excepted againſt him. Tranſient Actions are of two ſorts, and unto what ſort of tranſient Actions forgiveneſſe of ſinne is to bee reſerred.

    _ CHAP. XXIII. That remiſsion of ſin, (quoad terminum remotum, or as in execution) is a real, yea, Phyſicall change,What is ſaid in this Conſectary, I mean concerning remiſſion of ſin in execution, & not of remiſſion, as barely diſobliging to puniſhment, wch in the cloſe of this conſectary I do acknowledge to be but a change of our relation. and not a change purely Relative, as is commonly ſuppoſed.

    _ CHAP. XXIV. The Deſcription of forgiveneſſe of ſin, given by that very learned and godly Divine, Dr. Twiſſe (which is by ſome highly commended as moſt accurate) examined and refuted; and the evil conſequences of the ſame detected; together with the Authors Apology for his taking upon him in ought to expreſſe his diſſent from men of ſuch prime worth, (Stars of the first Magnitud) as confeſſedly that Doctor was.

    _ CHAP. XXV. That a Believer, his pardon notwithſtanding, is in his confeſsion of ſin to put himſelf under the curſe of the Law; Why and how declared. That a ſinner after pardon, is a ſinner, and that God doth look upon him as a ſinner, albeit he
doth not deal with him, or puniſh him as ſuch.

    _ CHAP. XXVI. That a Believer during his warfare on earth, is to fear Hell and damnation; why, and how proved and manifeſted; as alſo cleered in the way of anſwer to ſeveral Objections,
notwithſtanding the Doctrine of Perſeverance of the Saints be acknowledged; in anſwer to which objections, the conſiſtency and co-operation of the love of God, and the fear of God is proved. What manner of fear it is that love doth expel, and what manner of fear it is that love doth retain declared: Notwithſtanding, that Believers are reſtrained by the love of God, yet that God doth uſe ſeveral other means whereby to conſtraine; i. e. effectually to induce them, proved: and what thoſe ſeveral means are, ſpecified more at large. The conſiſtency and co-operation of faith and fear, maintained and proved. That filial and ſlaviſh fear do not d•ffer in their object matter, or in the thing feared, but in the manner
of fearing, aſſerted, and how, proved and cleered by a due interpretation of that Scripture in Luke 1.74. The difference betwixt fear as it is the fruit of the ſpirit of bondage, and as a fruit of the Spirit of Adoption, opened and aſſerted.

    _ CHAP. XXVII. That a Miniſter of the Goſpel hath no warrant ſo to abſolve a Believer, as in the name of God to tell him, That his ſins are as abſolutely pardoned, and that he is as abſolutely ſure of heaven, as if he were already in heaven.

    _ CHAP. XXVIII. That the repentance, which the Goſpel requires, is not only repentance [from] the pardon of our ſins, as the Antinomians affirm, but [for] the pardon of them, proved and evinced by ſeveral Arguments. Several Objections of the Antinomians anſwered; wherein it is punctually declared, In what ſenſe Evangelical Repentance may be ſaid to be [from] pardon of ſin, and in what ſenſe [for] the pardon of it. It is diſputable whether Gods glory and our own ſalvation are to be looked at as two
ends, or only as one, the former being a neceſſary reſult of the latter. An Objection anſwered, That it is a ſingular favour of God, and a favour in ſome ſenſe peculiar to the times of the New Teſtament, that God hath ſo cleerly revealed unto us our eternal ſalvation, as the great end, not excluding, but including his glory) of mans working, or of all Chriſtian duty. That good works may be ſtiled the way to ſalvation. That the difference betwixt the Covenant of Work and of Grace lyes not in this, that Adam was to work for life, and we not for, but only from life. Our own good works, duties graces or holineſſe, how far forth, or in what ſenſe to be diſclaimed, and not truſted unto for ſalvation, as alſo in what ſenſe, or how farre
forth they may be truſted unto, or reſted in for ſalvation, declared more at large. A Caution annexed to prevent miſtake. That there are two kinds of preſumption, both which are diſtinctly to be made knowne unto people by the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and carefully to be avoided by all, as dangerous rocks in the ſteering of our courſe towards the haven of eternal happineſſe.

    _ CHAP. XXIX. The Concluſion.
