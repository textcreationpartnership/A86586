            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Reverend Author of this enſuing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, hath it ſeemes, ſuch humble thoughts of himſelfe, and theſe his Labours, that unleſſe ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe lead them forth into the publick light, they muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to unprofitable obſcurity. I apprehend my ſelfe the moſt unfit of any for ſuch an office, were it but becauſe I found, it had pleaſed him to make ſuch mention of my name, as I may not approve of; and well knowing that wee might hear a <hi>Mulus Mulum ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit;</hi> from the partie that will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be offended at his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. But when it pleaſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb facs="tcp:170180:5"/>to remit his Exercitation into my hands, with a ful and final Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that by me it ſhould live or die (on what reaſon I little know,) I durſt not ſtand on ſuch perſonal punctillio's, nor be guilty of ſuch cruelty as to ſtifle ſuch a birth, for the avoiding of the toothed cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of thoſe men, who are impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to them that bow not to their Judgments; and whoſe good words can never be won with Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but onely with a compliance with the Intereſt of their Party, and a liſting our ſelves and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Colours of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, and Conduct of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired Leaders, againſt the Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt, and the unity and Purity of his Church. I know it is none of the Authors expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I ſhould juſtifie every word in his writings: I dare not doe ſo by my own: nor will hee do it himſelf. Nor is it an applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Commendation that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but an Impartiall cenſure, and what intimations may be moſt profitable to the Reader. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb facs="tcp:170180:5"/>hee hath not been raſh in fixing on the Concluſions in this booke; but hath tendered it to ſeveral Learned, Judicious Divines, eſteemed Orthodox, for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſall and Cenſure: and where ſome of them have adviſed to the alteration of ſome phraſes, hee hath condeſcended very much to their deſires.</p>
            <p>Though he be my Countrey man, I have no further acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Authour, then an houre or two's conference, and the peruſall of his papers, and the good report of others doe afford me: by which I judge him a grave, pious, ſober Divine, not ſo quick and ſharp, as deliberately Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſolid, not made ſo much for words as Matter, nor to pleaſe mens eares with ſmoothneſſe and eloquence, as to informe their Judgements by a plaine diſcovery of practicall Truths. I perceive he liveth not far from the place where Dr. <hi>Criſpe</hi> did exerciſe his Miniſtry; and ſo having more to doe with the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> either
<pb facs="tcp:170180:6"/>for their recovery, or the Defence of the Truth againſt them, then in moſt other parts our Miniſters have; and more need to fortifie the people againſt the infection of their errors; it turned much of the ſtreame of his ſtudies and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours this way. God hath made the ſeverall errours that have riſen in moſt ages, an occaſion of the clearing and advantaging his truth; and one errour a meanes of the deſtruction of another. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts errors in the point of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the Merit of works, and other ſuch like ſelfe aſcribing conceits, did occaſion from <hi>Luther, Melancthon,</hi> and other leading Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of thoſe times, a more ample diſcovery of the freeneſſe of Gods grace, and a fuller vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the ſufficiency of the blood of Chriſt, then elſe the Church had been like to have ſo ſoone enjoyed. When the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry errour was ſowne by <hi>Iſlebius</hi> and his <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and too much watered by <hi>Illiricus</hi> and his <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> and growne to maturity
<pb facs="tcp:170180:6"/>in the former Libertines and late <hi>Antinomians</hi> here with our ſelves; God made this an occaſion to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken his Miniſters to maintaine more vigorouſly the uſe of the Law, the neceſſity of Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Obedience, and more clearely to open the nature of the Covenants, &amp; the Reaſon of Duty, then formerly had been done; yet were the writings but few &amp; brief that have been publiſhed againſt this kinde of men, (except onely thoſe between the <hi>Majoriſts</hi> and the <hi>Flaccians,</hi> who were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what learned men) becauſe the opinions of theſe Libertines were ſo carnall and groſſe, and their lives ordinarily ſo ſcandalous, and the ends of many of them ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that through Gods mercy, it was but very few that were ſeduced by them; and both they and their reaſonings did ſeeme ſo contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, that learned men thought it needleſſe to trouble themſelves with them: eſpecially having a learned, and ſubtile kinde of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary on the other ſide, (the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt
<pb facs="tcp:170180:7"/>and <hi>Arminian</hi>) that found them worke. The turbulency and ſcandalouſneſſe of ſome of them in <hi>London,</hi> firſt drew forth Dr. <hi>Taylors Regula Vitae:</hi> But lately they were headed by many pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick preachers; <hi>Eaton, Town, Randall, Simpſon, Saltmarſh,</hi> but the man that moſt credited and ſtrengthned their party was Dr. <hi>Criſpe:</hi> Theſe have occaſioned thoſe profitable labours of Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> Maſter <hi>Burges,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> againſt them, ſeconded by Mr. <hi>Bedford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Geree,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: And Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now drawn forth againſt them that Judicious man Mr. <hi>Benjamin Woodbridge.</hi> And this Exercitation doth next take its place in this Army that is engaged againſt the Libertines: which though it be yet the laſt, and one of the leaſt in my Judgment, is not the leaſt uſefull. Divers weighty Truths are here aſſerted and cleared, which too many have overlook't: the objections of the Adverſary are ſolidly anſwered. The onely
<pb facs="tcp:170180:7"/>or chiefe thing that is like to be offenſive to ſome of the Orthodox, is the Authors too free declaring his diſſent about certaine Propoſitions from many of his brethren, and that by name. Had he beene as well acquainted with mens impatiencie of contradiction, as I am; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he would have declined this way. That none of the brethren excepted againſt, have reaſon to ſuppoſe me to be intereſſed againſt them, or to ſubſcribe to ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions may appeare in that it hath pleaſed the Author to put me alſo in the number.</p>

But moſt deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the practice of thoſe men that under pretence of being Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxe, and enemies to errour, are carried ſo violently in the ſtream of their party, that they are not able with any patience to hear or read a line that accuſeth that party of miſtake, or that differeth from them, though but in method or terms: and though it be with the greateſt humility, ſubmiſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and hatred of diſſenſions; yea though it be directly for peace, by reconciling the differences of ſeveral parties, that by their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have long troubled the Church. Theſe men look not far beyond the borders of their owne party, but live among them, as if they were all the Church, or the world; (Like the fellow, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never gone out of the City he was born in, imagined that the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:170180:8"/>their party, doth keepe the unity and peace of the Church. Be it but one ſchiſmatical congregation of Separatiſts, Anabaptiſts, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians, who themſelves have divided from almoſt all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt on earth, yet they ſeeme to affect a unity in their own ſeparated body, and wil condemne a man for diſturbing the peace of their Church. So is it with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the greater parties, called <hi>Lutherans, Calviniſts,</hi> &amp;c. But none ſo horridly guilty of this, as the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who wil needs have it to be all one to be of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> and of the Catholick; and to differ from the <hi>Roman,</hi> as to differ from the Catholick. Shall we imitate them in this, and make a Popery of our owne, whilſt we contend againſt theirs? Yet alas, how common is it with us? Who can deny it? The <hi>Lutherans</hi> are more perverſely guilty of it, then wee. Yet I muſt ſpeak to thoſe that are within hearing of mee, If a true Catholick Chriſtian that underſtandeth the unity of the
<pb facs="tcp:170180:9"/>Church, and abhorreth the name of parties, and deſireth their recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation for a recovery of unity, do but take on him to ſhew any party that they have run into ſome extreme, in ſome leſſer points; and how that miſtake hath occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned diviſion, and ſtill alienates the other party, and that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing of that errour would tend to a reconcilement; How furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly do a ſort of factious (though godly and Learned) men riſe up againſt him, and charge him with innovation, with bringing new light, and breaking the peace of the Church, as if he were the ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, and had a mind to head a Party, whoſe mind is to endeavour that there might be no parties, but a unity? as if all the kernell of the Church were within our nutſhell: as if all were new, that is new to the eares of that ſociety: And as if he did charge the whole Church with errour, or thought himſelfe wiſer then the whole Church, or did diſturbe the peace of the whole Church, who doth but ſuppoſe
<pb facs="tcp:170180:9"/>one party to have ſome miſtakes, and ſeeke to cure them. As if in a ſeparated congregation of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts or Antinomians, they ſhould charge me with innovation, and thinking my ſelf wiſer then all the Church, becauſe I ſay that infants muſt be baptized, or that elect infidels are not in Chriſt, nor pardoned, nor abſolved from the guilt of ſin: were not this ridici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous vanity? yet can theſe ſame men that ſeem ſo zealous for unity and peace, and the credit of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, not only be well contented, that we be zealous againſt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers but their party, but alſo doe applaud that man as Orthodox, that will clamour and raile againſt them, and cry them downe as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall, or moſt furiouſly cenſure them to be none of the Church, or ſo deſperately corrupted, that there muſt be no talke of reconlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and he that flies furtheſt from their opinions, (as if there were no extreme on the other hand) doth beſt eſcape the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this ſort of men, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilers
<pb facs="tcp:170180:10"/>are ſtil ſuſpected as guilty complyers. And thus godly and zealous men, while they are too confident of the judgment of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their party, are made the great enemies of truth, and the unity of the Church; and lay thoſe grounds which would make the wounds of the Church uncurable. And though they are diſabled from laying violent hands on diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, yet by their keene and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cenſures of all that ſtep out of the road of their party, they have brought things to that paſſe, that ſtudents lie under a ſtrong temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to ſtudy no further, then to know what is the opinion which is moſt in credit, and which their leaders hold, and to take heed of knowing any more then others in the leaſt point; and to ſhun all things that tend to a reconciling of the Churches; yea, and to make ſome raving onſet on others, if they mean to be glorious among their own.</p>
            <p>They ſay, If this ſhould keepe out ſome truthes, yet withall it
<pb facs="tcp:170180:10"/>will keep out hereſies, whilſt all innovations are kept in ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. But I doubt, it rather oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioneth hereſies, ſeeing it is the property of hereticks to affect ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, and to make it their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry among their own party, to be vilified by others. For my part, I believe one Catholick Church, and the Communion of Saints: and when I preach to one congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, I remember how ſmal a part of the Church they are. And when I write of the opinions of any one party, I remember how many there be of another mind. But theſe men object, that the number of the erroneous is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded; ſeeing it is our party only that is in the right, and hath the Scripture on their ſide, their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and unity is to be defended, and the reſt, if they wil have unity, muſt come over unto them. To which I anſwer, that I doe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently believe, that no one party on earth is ſo ſound in Doctrine, and way of worſhip, as thoſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Calviniſts.</hi> But to think that
<pb facs="tcp:170180:11"/>any one party is infallible, or hath ſo ingroſt the truth, that others may not in ſome points be righter then they, or that they may not be guilty of running too farre in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one point, either by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of prejudice, or heat of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſome other diſadvantage, temptation, or imperfection; this is ſuch arrogancy as modeſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould not be guilty of; Much leſſe ſhould they be unwilling to heare and try whether it be ſo or not. Undoubtedly there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny differences that ſeeme real and momentous through miſ-informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and prejudice, which indeed are but in words or methods, or of inferiour nature. And abundance of good might be done by drawing differences into a narrower com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, and diſcovering the true point of diſagreement, and cutting off all the ſuperfluous contentions; were it not that by zealous, cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious faction, and by men that know not what Spirit they are of, the world is ſwayed by reproaches and prejudice, and the matter
<pb facs="tcp:170180:11"/>brought to that paſſe, that none can ſet their hand to ſo bleſſed a work, til they firſt reſolve to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject themſelves to the ſcorne and ſlanders even of Divines, and to caſt overboard their intereſt and reputation even with zealous, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men. And how few are they even among thoſe that can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the cenſures of the openly profane, that are able to deny themſelves ſo far, as to conquer in this aſſault? We look on the ignorant vulgar as fooles, and therfore pride it ſelfe can ſpare their applauſes. But when wee take ſuch pious perſons, and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Divines to be men of valuable judgments, that are able indeede to honour or diſhonour us: How hardly will a proud heart lie down to be trod upon? Think not that I injuriouſly diſhonour the pious, or the Church guides, in ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any or many of them to be ſuch, and become ſuch inſtruments to hinder the work of Chriſt, and to further the cauſe and kingdom of the divel; were they perfect
<pb facs="tcp:170180:12"/>Saints, it would not be ſo: But he that obſerveth not the ſad imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the beſt of Saints, and how farre they make them ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the enemie, and that all men, even the beſt are vanity and lyars, and that the Churches grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt danger is from it ſelfe, more then from all enemies without; yea, and that every one is the greateſt enemy to himſelfe; he knoweth not himſelf, he hath ſure beene a ſleepe, at leaſt theſe 12 years, and not ſeen the diſcoveries that our late tryals have made; and he hath more of the Popiſh opinion of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection then is ſafe. To be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant after our convincing experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, is to be mad. Well may the beſt of Divines ſay to them that call them Rabbie, and ſee wholly with their eyes, and bow down to their underſtandings, as the Angel ſaid to John, <hi>Rev</hi> 22.9. ſee thou doe it not, for I am thy fellow ſervant, and of thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and of them which keepe the ſayings of this book. Which I ſpeak not to diminiſh the juſt eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb facs="tcp:170180:12"/>and authority of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, which I am blamed by ſome for maintaining, to be ſo great; and which God of late hath vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, by delivering their moſt raging enemies (Quakers and ſuch like) to be plainly poſſeſt or ruled by the divel; nor yet do I lay theſe accuſations upon all; ſeeing by the great mercy of God, we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of eminent moderation and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety; and I obſerve among the beſt, that within this year or two their zeale for the Churches unity is very much increaſed, for which I heartily bleſſe the Lord. But the number of ſuch is too ſmal, and of the ſelfe conceited and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſo conſiderable, as cannot be hid.</p>
            <p>For my owne part, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that it is but about the ſixth part of the world, that are Chriſtians, (all the reſt being Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, Infidels, and Mahometans) and of that ſixth part, how few the Proteſtants are, in compariſon of the Papiſts, the Greeks, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſines and the reſt, and of the
<pb facs="tcp:170180:13"/>Proteſtants, how many countries are Lutherans, beſides all others; I confeſſe; I have no great zeale to confine the Church to the party that I beſt like, nor to ſhut Chriſt out of all other Societies, and coope him up to the congregations of thoſe few that ſay to all the reſt of the Church, Stand by, wee are more holy then you. In a word, and a plaine word, I am loth to make Chriſt only the head of the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> in ſtead of being the head of Chriſtians and Catholicks, and loth he ſhould ceaſe to be the head of the body, and become on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the head of any party or faction; and therefore I would contribute the utmoſt of my endeavours to reconcile the differing members of that body. If I have digreſſed unprofitably, I crave pardon, and returne to the ſubject of this Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the Reverend Authour ſeems to mee in ſome few paſſages to have expreſt his mind ſomewhat obſcurely, or in terms lyable to miſ-conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
<pb facs="tcp:170180:13"/>I ſhall adventure upon a preſumption of his conſent, to give the Reader a key for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of them, and to tell him my thoughts of ſome of them in particular (leaving the reſt to his judgment.) As to the nature of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin) from which all the conſectaries of this Treatiſe are drawn,) I conceive there are three diſtinct ſpecies of it, ariſing from the three parts of Gods regiment of mankind. 1. As God is Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator, he doth conferre on all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers a right to impunity, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the obligation to puniſhment; in regard of the Law of works, he doth this as he is about that law, by relaxing it. In regard of the Law of grace, he doth it as the free Legiſlator thereof. And it is this law it ſelf or promiſe that is his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of doing it, and the act of that Law, which is his pardoning act; it is conditional to all, before faith. It is actual pardon to thoſe only that believe. I conceive this pardon is the main obſervable Act, that Scriptures and Divines
<pb facs="tcp:170180:14"/>do commonly treat of: And that it is the ſame in ſubſtance with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification conſtitutive, though ſome reſpective difference is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in the terms.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As God is judge of the world according to his lawes, ſo he hath a ſentential remiſſion of ſinne, or juſtification. But there is this difference between theſe two terms: Remiſſion of ſin doth more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifie the legal or donative remiſſion, and leſſe properly the judicial ſentence, it being in ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſenſe the Prerogative of a Ruler as he is above all law, to pardon the faults againſt the Law; and not of a Judge, who as ſuch, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by law: yet the word <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> may be applied to the ſentence too. But contrarily juſtification ſignifieth very fitly both acts, legal and judiciall; but more fully and ſtrictly, the <hi>ſentence,</hi> then the <hi>grant;</hi> And therefore <hi>juſtificatio juris, &amp; juſtificatio judicis,</hi> is a moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, currant diſtinction: but <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatio judicis</hi> is the more proper phraſe. But <hi>remiſſio juris et judicis</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170180:14"/>is tolerable, but the later mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſomewhat leſs proper.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As God is the executioner of his laws, either in this life, before the final ſentence (for ſome mens ſins goe before to judgment, and ſome follow after) or in the life to come, ſo it belongeth to him actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to puniſh or to remit puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and thus his pardon is, not to puniſh: yet not ſimply not to puniſh, but not to puniſh one that deſerved it. This I call, for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſake, executive pardon Now I conceive, that the word <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> hath principall reſpect to the obligation and ſentence, and leſſe to the puniſhment. But the word <hi>Remiſſion</hi> more empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically connoteth the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then the Obligation diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and yet the Obligation more then the ſentence. It ſeems to me that this Reverend Author doth ſometime looke only at the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive Remiſſion in his Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries; ſometime at the Legall Remiſſion; and ſometime hee joyneth them together as one. And
<pb facs="tcp:170180:15"/>it muſt be confeſt, that this laſt is the full end and perfection of both the former, and the former are both but meanes to this. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth God give us pardon, and judge us pardoned, that we may eſcape the Penalty and live. The Reverend Author calls this the ultimate Terme, and the diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Obligation the neereſt: which may admit of a double ſenſe: Either as this ſpecies of executive pardon is the end of the foreſaid ſpecies of pardon: or as Impunity enters the Definition of the Donative or Legall ſort of Pardon: and ſo it is not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>in eſſe exiſtenti,</hi> as in executive pardon it is; but as future and <hi>in eſſe volito.</hi> And ſo as Guilt (or Obligation to puniſhment, which is all one) is the neereſt terme, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying this ſort of pardon; ſo Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity is the remote terme, ſeeing the Obligation diſſolved is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to Puniſhment. Reader, here's nothing but whats obvious, and beyond queſtion for the truth; and if thou have but the skill to
<pb facs="tcp:170180:15"/>uſe the Key of this diſtinction of Remiſſion, and apply it to ſome dubious paſſages in the Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will prevent thy miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and I ſuppoſe, thy wronging of the Author, and thy cauſeleſſe offence. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 10. where he ſaith that Guilt is taken ſometime for the puniſhment it ſelfe, I confeſſe I have not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſo much; nor yet doe. So <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 12. Nor do I ſuppoſe that the <hi>Reatus redundans in perſonam</hi> containes puniſhment it ſelfe, but onely connotes it as the Terme of the Obligation. Therefore when <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 10. he ſaith, pardon is not a freeing us from the ſimple Guilt and Defect, I ſhould, to avoid miſ-underſtanding, have left out the word <hi>guilt,</hi> and ſaid only it is the freeing us from the deſert, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have not obſerved it uſuall to make guilt to be the ſame with deſert. Though I confeſſe he may be called,

As to <hi>c.</hi> 18. <hi>n.</hi> 4. p. 33. I conceive that it is not the tenour of the Goſpel, but the law of nature that obligeth believers to puniſhment for a groſſe ſinne; and ſo it doth for the ſmalleſt; that this obligation is a making him guilty of death in general, but not of the loſſe of former Pardon in <hi>ſpecie:</hi> And that as Pardon is a Benefit of the new Convenant, which the old knew not: ſo the loſs of pardon, is a penalty threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the new Covenant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly. Though I ſuppoſe God ſuffers none to fall under that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty that were actually pardoned, as to the eternal Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Ch.</hi> 23. <hi>Conſ.</hi> 17. he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyeth Juſtification to be a change meerely Relative, his Reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the ſame with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb facs="tcp:170180:16"/>and Remiſsion is a real change, <hi>viz.</hi> not puniſhing. <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> But note,
<list>
                  <item>1 That he explains himſelfe to ſpeake only of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Remiſſion, which is nothing to the other two ſorts.</item>
                  <item>2. I thinke executive Remiſsion is not uſually called Juſtification. And therefore I ſhall ſtill ſay, that Juſtification is but a Relative change.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Ch.</hi> 25. <hi>Conſ.</hi> 19. where there is mention of Guilt in heaven, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the word can meane no more then that the Saints did deſerve Gods wrath: and whether that be a proper ſenſe of the word <hi>Guilt,</hi> or uſuall, I muſt leave to wiſer Lawyers then my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>I doe not take theſe or any the like obſcurityes or inprefections to be a ſufficient reaſon to quarrel with the labors of this Reverend man, much leſſe to deprive the Church of the benefit of them. Nay I hope it is no ſmall gaine that many will receive by it: (ſo far am I from damning, exploding, or contemning every thing that hath ſomewhat diſagreeable to my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb facs="tcp:170180:17"/>Doubtleſſe it muſt needs be very uſeful to ordinary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to ſee the nature of pardon more plainly, and to ſee ſuch cleare Reaſons for a Neceſſity of our dayly praying for pardon, yea for pardon of the ſame ſins that were before pardoned; and to ſee Providential, Caſtigatory Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo wel reconciled with the fulneſſe of Chriſts ſatisfaction for the ſame ſins; and to ſee ſuch full Evidence for a neceſſity of holy fear &amp; working out our ſavaltion, yet without aſcribing any merit unto man; to ſee the Reaſon of the neceſſity that the promiſe of our continued and final Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhould be on the condition of our perſeverance, and ſo that continued and final Juſtification be but conditionall; and this not onely conſiſtent with the certaine perſeverance of the Saints, but alſo the ordinate ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional meanes of their perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; to ſee the imperfection of that Remiſſion and Juſtification which we have in this life, beyond
<pb facs="tcp:170180:17"/>all reaſonable exception manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted; with many the like points, I conceive will have much influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on mens affections and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, and free them from ſome miſtakes that doe no whit befriend their Graces, nor a Godly life. But I muſt from experience adviſe the Reverend Author to expect the offence of ſome, the bitter cenſures of others, and perhaps to be ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſnarled at, if not be worried by ſome of the fautours of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine ſect, or ſome that make a trade of voluminous Diſputation; if they finde him not in their rode, they may ſeeke him by a Digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and ſuch men are never out of their way. If I may adviſe him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they convince him of ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake to be revoked, he ſhould hear them as if he heard them not, and never thinke of wording it with them, but ſuffer them to eaſe themſelves without Contradiction, and leave the ſucceſſe of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to God. The Lord pitty his poore, divided, imperfect Church, and acquaint the Guides with the
<pb facs="tcp:170180:18"/>Neceſſity of its Unity, and thoſe Principles which have a tendency to the healing of our breaches, and powre out more adundance of the Spirit of Illumination, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and purity, that with one (and that a Pure and Charitable) Mind and Mouth, we may Glorifie God. <hi>Amen.</hi> Thus daily Prayeth</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170180:22"/>becauſe our cleanſing from unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is in the text promiſed as a merit, not commanded as a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

               <p n="1">1. The ground or reaſon of them, which ſaid ground or reaſon ſeems to be taken from that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of phraſe, whereby ſin, and the fruits or iſſues of ſin are ſet forth and ſignified in Scripture: for according to the various names or titles given to ſin, and the effects thereof, ſuch are the various names or expreſſions of Gods pardon or not pardon of ſin. For example, As ſin is ſtiled
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170180:26"/>
                  <hi>filthineſs</hi> or <hi>uncleanneſs</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19. So the pardon of ſin is ſtiled, <hi>waſhing, cleanſing, covering, purging away.</hi> As ſin is the ſouls ſickneſs or diſeaſe (in which ſenſe ſome Expoſitors do underſtand that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.3. <hi>Who forgiveth all thy ſins, and healeth all thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes.</hi>) Or as ſin doth wound the ſinner, ſo pardon is ſtiled <hi>Healing.</hi> As ſin maketh us guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo the pardon of ſin is ſtiled, Gods not imputing it, his not lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to our charge; and his not pardoning us, is ſaid to be his not cleering us, or holding us guiltleſs. As ſin makes us wretched and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable; ſo pardon of ſin is ſtiled Gods being merciful to the ſin or ſinner. As ſin is ſtiled a Debt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us lyable to God in ſuch ſort as Debtors to their Creditors, ſo Gods pardoning mercy is ſaid to be his blotting out our ſins, &amp; caſting them into the depths of the ſea. And in this ſort <hi>(alluſivè)</hi> the Apoſtles phraſe in the Text, which is now before us, ſeemes to be (the expreſs word being <gap reason="foreign">

Deliverance,</hi> and <hi>ſetting at liberty.</hi> It ſeems to be a Metaphor taken from thoſe who are looſened from their bonds, or delivered out of priſon, into which they were caſt for their Debts, or miſdemeanors. To proceed, As the ſinner by committing ſin doth (as it were) arm his ſin againſt himſelf; or as ſin hath a power accrewing to it, (as I may ſo ſay) to do us miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief by vertue of the Law's commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (for which cauſe the Law is ſaid to be the <hi>ſtrength of ſin,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.56.) ſo Gods pardoning ſin is ſaid to be his ſubduing our ſin, or giving victory to the ſinner over his ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 57. <hi>Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> As ſin makes us obnoxious to Gods
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170180:27"/>hatred and abhorring; ſo Gods pardoning the ſinner is ſaid to be Gods gracious receiving the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2. <hi>Take away all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and receive us graciouſly.</hi> And contrarily, Gods not pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us, is ſaid to be his not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let it be obſerved and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the moſt of the ſaid various expreſſions are alluſive Tranſlations, or metaphorical; being ſpoken of God after the manner of men, in them <hi>Deus hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum dicit,</hi> God doth condeſcend to our capacity, he doth <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">3 We are to calculate (as I may ſo ſay) our ſenſe and conſtructions of the ſaid phraſes according to the meridian of the Divine Nature: I mean, we are to conſtrue them in no other ſenſe, then the Eſſence Nature, and Properties of the Godhead or Deity will permit.

               </p>
               <p>For the former then, bee it known.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Gods pardoning a ſin, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is not his freeing the ſinner from the very fact of ſin. Not ſo: for this is impoſſible <hi>ex natura rei;</hi> it is (I ſay) a thing ſimply impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, implying a palpable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. What is once done, can never be undone, or rendred not done. That which is once paſt, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by the power of God be made or rendred not paſt; in ſo ſaying, I would be underſtood in <hi>ſenſu com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitiva:</hi> for although whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is done or paſt, might by the power of God have been preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and in ſuch a divided ſenſe might never have been done, or come to paſſe; yet being once done and paſt, it cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, recalled, or rendred not come to paſſe it being a flat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that a thing ſhould be done, and not done, paſt and not paſt, come to paſſe, and not come to paſſe.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:170180:32"/>
               <p n="2">2. It is not Gods freeing a ſinner from the fault of ſin; <hi>i.e.</hi> the faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe and ſinfulneſſe of ſin: It is not <hi>Peccata non peccata facere,</hi> or <hi>Peccata pro non peccatis habere</hi> (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the phraſe according to its ſimple and abſolute import, and not with a <hi>quaſi</hi> or <hi>tanquam,</hi> which doth much qualifie and alter the ſenſe of the expreſſion). I ſay, Pardon of ſin is not ſo to be taken, for this alſo is impoſſible, <hi>ex natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra rei,</hi> and doth <hi>implicare,</hi> involve a contradiction; <hi>viz.</hi> That a fact ſhould be faulty and not faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a ſin and not a ſin: for take away ſinfulneſſe from a fact, and it doth no longer remain ſinful. It is therefore to be obſerved, That a ſin pardoned is as well a ſin, yea, as much a ſin; <hi>i.e.</hi> every whit as ſinful as ever it was before the pardon of it. When a Prince or State doth pardon a Delinquent, or Malefactor, they do not, yea they cannot thereby make them of Delinquents no Delinquents, or of Malefactors no Malefactors. To clear one (<hi>e. g.</hi> an accuſed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170180:32"/>perſon) from the fact or faultineſs of the fact wherewith he is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, is one thing; and to pardon a perſon ſo accuſed, is another. God by doing the latter, doth not do, and therefore cannot be ſaid to do the former. When a ſinner therefore is pardoned, we muſt not conceive that he is thereby made innocent again.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Gods pardoning a ſin or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is not his freeing them from the ſimple guilt and deſert; I mean, their guiltineſs and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of puniſhment. I uſe theſe latter words to explain the former; For though the word, <hi>Reatus,</hi> or Guilt, be a word much in uſe both in Authours and in our Sermons, yet is it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ambiguous and of doubtful conſtruction, being ſometimes taken for the deſerving of puniſhment, and ſometimes for the puniſhment it ſelf deſerved, and ſometimes for both. Yea, in ſuch various ſenſes I take the word to be uſed in the Text, at leaſt in the Tranſlation of ſundry Scriptures. For example, <hi>Num.</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:170180:33"/>35.27. Where it being laid down as a Law, <hi>That if the Revenger of blood finding the man-ſlayer without the borders of the city of Refuge, ſhall there kill the ſlayer, he ſhall not be guilty of blood;</hi> that is, as I conceive, he doth not deſerve or incur the deſert of puniſhment, neither ſhall he ſuffer for it. <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.9. Where God commanding that the City-Inhabitants next to any place where an unknowne murder was committed, being commanded to offer a certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Sacrifice,<note place="margin">Prov. 30.10. <hi>Leſt he curſe thee, and thou be found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: i.e.</hi> Leſt thou ſin, &amp; ſuffer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly; otherwiſe the curſe cauſeleſſe ſhall not come, and is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be feared.</note> God doth there promiſe, that <hi>they ſhall put away the guilt of innocent blood from among them;</hi> that is, (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) the puniſhment which the ſhedding of that innocent blood did deſerve. <hi>Levit.</hi> 5.5. where it being declared in what ſpecial caſes a ſoul ſhould be guilty, I conceive, that by guilt there is meant, as ſin it ſelf, ſo the deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of puniſhment.</p>
               <p>However I may be miſtaken in the exact ſenſe of the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Scriptures, (about which I
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170180:33"/>liſt not to contend with any men of a contrary mind) yet ſure I am that the word <hi>Guilt</hi> as commonly uſed, is ſometimes taken for the bare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of puniſhment, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the puniſhment it ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, which two the Schoolmen do uſually diſtinguiſh, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being by them ſtiled <hi>Reatus Simplex,</hi> ſimple guilt, and the latter<note n="*" place="margin">Yet not as exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but as includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap> of which more diſtinctly I ſhall ſpeak by and by. Concerning Guilt taken in theſe two ſenſes; (<hi>viz.</hi> for the deſerving of puniſhment and for puniſhment it ſelf deſerved) let the Reader obſerve, That when we commonly ſay, That the guilt of our ſins was imputed unto Chriſt, that ſaying muſt be underſtood, as guilt is taken in the latter ſenſe, but not in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; <hi>viz.</hi> for the puniſhment, which we for our ſins (and not he upon any ſuch account) did deſerve.</note> 
                  <hi>Reatus redundans in perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi> guilt running over from the ſin upon the ſinner. Now I ſay That Gods pardoning a ſin or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is not his freeing it, or the ſinner from the ſimple gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For, 1. As was ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foregoing particulars, ſo
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170180:34"/>it may be ſaid concerning this; <hi>viz.</hi> That it doth <hi>implicare,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a contradiction; namely, That a ſin ſhould be an offence againſt Gods Law, threatning puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet ſhould not deſerve the puniſhment threatned by that Law. As ſinfulneſſe, ſo guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of puniſhment is impoſſible, <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> to be ſeparated from any ſin or ſinner; I mean, the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a compound ſenſe; <hi>e. g.</hi> Though it was poſſible to the power of God to have prevented a ſinner from becoming a ſinner, and ſo from becoming guilty of, or deſerving puniſhment; yet it is impoſſible, that he ſhould be made in ſuch a ſenſe not ſinful, as not to have incurred the deſert of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and as in it ſelf conſidered, not ſtill to deſerve puniſhment. I ſay, in it ſelf conſidered: for (as I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak by and by) we are to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt puniſhment as deſerved by ſin, or by the ſinner in himſelf, or by it ſelf conſidered; and betwixt dueneſſe of puniſhment to the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170180:34"/>ſin or ſinner, as conſidered with reference unto ſatisfaction made for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the pardoning of a ſin or ſinner, it is no way neceſſary for the benefit or behoof of a ſinner, that God ſhould free the ſaid ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (were ſuch a freedom in its own nature not impoſſible) from the ſimple guilt or deſerving of puniſhment: for ſuch a ſinner may be altogether freed from ſuffering his deſerved puniſhment, though he be never freed from deſerving the ſuffering of that puniſhment. Yea, a ſinner may in ſuch ſort, and as much be freed from ſuffering the puniſhment, which he hath by his fins deſerved, as if he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver committed any ſin whereby to have deſerved ſuch puniſhment; as is, and will be manifeſted in the experience of the glorified Saints, who notwithſtanding their ſin and deſert of ſin, are or ſhall be <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170180:35"/>the ſinner from the deſerving of ſuffering, (he or his ſin being in themſelves conſidered) I ſay, <hi>Cui bono?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Caution.</hi> We are carefully to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh (as was before intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) betwixt the ſimple demerit of ſin, or a ſinner deſerving of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment by his ſin, as conſidered barely in himſelf, or in his ſin; and betwixt dueneſſe of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the perſon of the ſinner, as conſidered with reſpect to his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the ſatisfaction which Chriſt hath made for the pardon of ſin: for notwithſtanding the demerit of ſin, or a ſinners deſerving of puniſhment be never taken away, yet upon ſome extrinſecal account or conſideration (ſuch as is the ſatisfaction made by the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) dueneſſe of puniſhment or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to ſuffer puniſhment, may be taken away from the ſinner, as ſhall by and by be declared, when I come to ſhew Affirmatively wherein the pardon of ſin doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4 For God to pardon a ſin or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170180:35"/>ſinner, is not for God (to ſpeak ſimply and abſolutely) not to ſee or behold the ſin, or not to ſee and behold the perſon as a ſinner, or for God to take no notice or knowledg at all of a ſin, or of a perſon as a ſinner: for this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is impoſſible. For albeit the pardon of ſin be expreſſed by his covering it, blotting it out, hiding his face from it, caſting it behind his back, (the meaning of which phraſes ſhall in due place be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted) nevertheleſs we may not conſtrue ſuch expreſſions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a bare, ſimple, and infinitive knowledge or ſight in God.

And what I ſay concerning Gods not ſeeing the ſame; I ſay, and in a like ſenſe, concerning Gods not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring ſin; <hi>viz.</hi> That the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin doth not conſiſt ſimply in Gods not remembring it, as if (to ſpeak ſimply and abſolutely)
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170180:36"/>God had utterly forgotten it, this alſo being a thing impoſſible, as to the nature of Almighty God, who as he hath had from all eternity the knowledg of whatſoever will be, ſo he will have unto all eternity the knowledg of whatſoever hath bin, there being with God, or as to his eternity, neither <hi>prius</hi> nor <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterius,</hi> and conſequently there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no difference betwixt Gods knowledge, fore-knowledge and remembrance, ſaving in order to the object only, but not to any act of Gods: ſo that as his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and fore-knowledg is not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to poſt-ſcience, ſo his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of things is not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to his former knowledg; but as his fore-knowledge doth ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie only a futurity of the object, ſo his remembrance ſignifies the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be paſt or as paſt; ſo that as Gods fore-knowledg is, a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſuch a thing will be, which is not (not a knowing that ſuch a thing is which is not) ſo Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance is a knowing, that ſuch a thing was, which albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it

               <p n="2">2. AS for the ſecond part of my intended anſwer, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer Affirmatively, <hi>viz.</hi> That Gods pardoning a ſinner is, his taking off the finners obligation to puniſhment, and conſequently in due time the puniſhment it ſelf; I have thus defined forgiveneſſe of ſin as taking my ayme from that which is contrary to it, <hi>viz.</hi> Guilt as guilt is taken not in ſuch a ſenſe as in which I afore ſaid,<note place="margin">In theſe two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts that <hi>Reatus</hi> which Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men call <hi>Reatus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundans in perſonam, viz.</hi> In a ſinners obligation to puniſhment; and in his actual ſuffering of that puniſhment to which he was obliged: having therefore afore ſaid, that <hi>Reatus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundans in perſonam,</hi> is with the Schoolemen a Sinners ſuffering his deſerved puniſhment, I would be underſtood not as excluding, but as including a ſinners perſonall obligation to the ſuffering of ſuch puniſhment. And here let me offer this to the obſervation of the Reader, <hi>viz.</hi> That as in ſome reſpect the ſinner is ſaid to make himſelf guilty, (<hi>viz.</hi> in reſpect of ſimple guilt or the bare deſerving of puniſhment;) ſo in reſpect of guilt redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, or the actuall ſuffering of the puniſhment it ſelfe deſerved, God is ſaid to make him guilty, for which ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.10. where Gods making the wicked guilty, is interpreted to be his deſtroying the ſinner.</note> that it is impoſſible to be taken away; but as it may bee taken, and as it is uſually taken in a ſecond ſenſe, 1. for Obligation, to puniſhment, in which ſenſe many doe define Guilt, ſaying, <hi>Reatus eſt obligatio ad poenam.</hi>

Had the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Doctor by Gods not willing to puniſh, meant God diſabling the Lawes obliging us to puniſhment, or his taking away our obligation to puniſhment, I had gone into his opinion, <hi>Manibus, pedibus</hi> (as the ſaying is;) I had fully, even to a tittle conſented with him: but he meaning therby another thing, I cannot (but with due reſpect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to the Learning and Piety of an Author ſo renowned) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly diſſent from him: For, by Gods not willing to puniſh a ſinner (for example, the faithful;

               <p>To the refuting of this opinion I ſhall take occaſion to ſpeake more at large hereafter. In the meane time, had the Doctor ſaid only this, That <hi>Remiſſio eſt ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil aliud quam puniendi nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1.

What is meant by forgiveneſſe of ſin evermore in the language of Scripture?</hi> And for proof of the truth of the ſaid deſcription; as a direct and full anſwer to the foreſaid Queſtion, I need not, as I preſume, to ſay much more then hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid concerning that, which in Scripture is made the direct oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to pardon; <hi>viz</hi> guilt (Gods not pardoning a ſinner, being ſaid to be Gods holding the ſinner guilty, or not guiltleſſe.) Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need I to inſtance in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Scriptures for the proving of it: it being ſufficient to ſay, That look in what place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſoever God doth promiſe pardon to the ſinner, or the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth beg pardon of God, ſtil there is meant in the ſenſe both of God and man, Gods not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſin or ſinner, either Gods
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170180:40"/>forbearing, or his ſurceaſing to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, in the ſenſe as was aforeſaid. The like alſo I ſay concerning all ſuch places of Scripture, wherein God doth declare himſelfe to have pardoned any ſin, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only adde two or three particulars as in the way of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the ſaid deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When I ſay that pardon of ſin doth conſiſt <hi>in diſſolutione ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligationis ad poenam,</hi> in diſſolving the obligation to puniſhment, I muſt not neceſſarily be underſtood of all manner of puniſhment, and <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> for the inſtant, preſent time; but either <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> or <hi>de future,</hi> either for the preſent or for the future: for albeit God pardoning the ſinner doth diſſolve the obligation to puniſhment, and doth thereby confer upon the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Jus ad liberationem,</hi> a right to impunity; nevertheleſſe this right to freedome from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be for preſent only from
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170180:41"/>a part of puniſhment, and ſo not a plenary freedome; but not from all puniſhment ſave only <hi>de futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> for the future, as I ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion afterwards to demonſtrate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When I ſay, That pardon of ſin doth conſiſt in a diſſolution of the obligation to puniſhment, I muſt not be underſtood neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and alwayes concerning an abſolute, but either an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute or conditional diſſolution. For I take remiſſion of ſin in this life to conſiſt only in a conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſſolution of the obligation; I mean, full remiſſion, or remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as to all manner of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the condition hereof being our perſeverance in the faith and fear of God: for as a ſinner is not actually remitted and diſcharged or diſobliged from puniſhment but upon the condition of his faith, repentance, &amp;c ſo neither is this diſcharge or diſobligation conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, but upon the condition of perſeverance. Though a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be actually diſobliged from puniſhment immediately upon his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170180:41"/>believing, and though the full and final pardon of ſuch a one, be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo certain in reſpect of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal purpoſe of God, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the purchaſe of Chriſt, (God having purpoſed and Chriſt having purchaſed for them grace, to perſevere) yet is it but conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal in the Covenant of Grace, or promiſe of the word. This ſeems to mee apparent by the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that perſon to whom God doth promiſe fully and finally to pardon: for which ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give a white ſtone:</hi> in which Scripture, obſerve two things:
<list>
                     <item>1. What is meant by the thing there promiſed under the name of a <hi>white ſtone? viz.</hi> Abſolution or pardon, the ſigne being put for the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified: the Apoſtle alluding in that expreſſion to the cuſtome of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> with whom a white ſtone was a ſigne of abſolution, as a black ſtone of condemnation.</item>
                     <item>2. To whom this abſolution is promiſed; <hi>viz.</hi> To him who doth overcome, or perſevere.</item>
                  </list> It is a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170180:42"/>vain thing to except, that perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is only a qualification in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or the qualification of a perſon to whom pardon ſhall be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or who ſhall fully and finally be pardoned: for, whatſoever is ſuch a qualification, hath the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a condition, without which the mercy ſhall not be continued, and perfectly enjoyed. It appears likewiſe by the expreſſe promiſes and threatnings of the Word; for which ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14. <hi>For we are made partakers of Chriſt, if we hold faſt,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. <hi>If we ſuffer for him, we ſhall reign with him: if we deny him, he alſo will deny us.</hi> Ezek 18.24. <hi>But when the righteous tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth away from his righteouſneſſe, and committeth iniquity, and doth according to all the abominations that a wicked man doth, ſhall he live? All his Righteouſneſs that he hath done ſhall not be mentioned, in his treſpaſs that he hath treſpaſſed, and in his ſin that he hath ſinned, in them ſhall he dye.</hi> Although the common ſaying of our Divines be (as I believe) a true ſaying, <hi>[Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170180:42"/>non redeunt,]</hi> yet I do not believe it to be true otherwiſe then upon ſuppoſition; <hi>viz.</hi> of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers perſeverance in Faith and Obedience: otherwiſe to what purpoſe is that admonition, 2 <hi>Joh</hi> 8. <hi>Look to your ſelves, that we loſe not the things which we have wrought?</hi> And that admonition to the like purpoſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Hold faſt that which thou haſt, that no man take thy crown?</hi> And other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, why ſhould God threaten to deal with Apoſtates, as with that wicked ſervant, whoſe doom we find recorded, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.32. <hi>O thou wicked ſervant, I forgave thee all that debt, becauſe thou deſinedſt me, ſhouldſt not thou alſo have had pity on thy fellow ſervant as I had pity on thee? And his Lord was wroth,</hi> &amp;c. I know what ſome do here except, ſaying. That the ſcope onely of a Parable is Argumentative; and the ſcope of that Parable is not to ſhew, That a ſinner may forfeit the benefit of his former pardon by relapſing into, and perſiſting in new ſins; but only to manifeſt,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170180:43"/>That forgiveneſs of others, is a neceſſary qualification to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given of God, or a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition without which God will not forgive us. Unto which I anſwer, That look as forgiveneſs of others is a condition without which God doth not at the firſt vouchſafe actual forgiveneſs to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſon, ſo the continuance of that forgiveneſs on mans part, is a condition of the continuance of forgiveneſs on Gods part, or a condition without which God will not forgive him at the laſt. I do willingly believe, That God uſeth theſe and the like condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al comminations, as a<note n="*" place="margin">And <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> I think thoſe do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be blamed, who are ſo zealous for the doctrin of the Saints per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, as they wil not patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer even thoſe who do hold the ſaid Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to uſe all ſuch means as God hath appointed to be uſed, and which God doth ſanctifie for that end, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which I doubt not, but this is one; <hi>viz.</hi> To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Saints, that their ſins are not abſolutely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned in this life, but conditionally, or upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their perſeverance; and that therefore they are to fear hell and damnation no leſſe then others, unleſſe they hold that faſt which they have: (of which ſaid fear I ſhall ſpeak more at large in <hi>Chap.</hi> 26.) whereupon I cannot but profeſſe my opinion, how (I think) that the foreſaid perſons are ſo affected in their zeal, that they do much diſſervice both to God and his Saints, as taking a direct way to confute the Doctrine of the Saints perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and to overthrow that in practice which they do labour to uphold in Doctrine; I mean, they do take the ready way to cauſe the Saints to Apoſtatize.</note> ſanctified meanes for the perſeverance of the Saints in the faith and fear of God: and therefore it is in no ſort agreeable unto my intent to urge thoſe and the like Scriptures to prove the Apoſtacy of the Saints; but only thereby to prove, That the continuance of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in this life is but upon the condition of our perſeverance, in which reſpect it is not abſolutely, but
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170180:43"/>conditionally in this life enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There being ſeveral ſorts and degrees of puniſhment; <hi>viz</hi> Puniſhments in this world, and puniſhments in the world to come; look how far forth, or in what ſenſe God doth forbear to puniſh, ſo far forth, or in that ſenſe, or with reſpect to that kind or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of puniſhment, but no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be underſtood, God in

Let this be obſerved the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will (as I verily think) ſerve as a clue or key to unlock and lead us through divers intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacyes and ambiguities of phraſe, where the pardon of ſin is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Scripture, which ſaid ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guities I ſhall in the following Chapters, as in their due place ſpecifie.</p>

               <p n="1">1. GODS forbearing, or ceaſing to puniſh ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with temporal puniſhments, is ſtiled his pardoning them, <hi>Num.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Pardon I beſeech thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) the iniquity of this people according to the greatneſs of thy mercy, as thou haſt forgiven this people from Egypt even till now.</hi> What was Gods forgiveneſſe of the people from <hi>Egypt</hi> until then, but Gods ſparing of them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of temporal judgments, either

So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.1, 2, 3. where Gods forgiving the iniquity of his people is interpreted to be Gods taking away all his wrath, and turning himſelfe from the fierceneſs of his anger. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily Gods puniſhing ſinners with temporal puniſhments, is ſtiled, his not pardoning them, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.42, 43. <hi>We have tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and rebelled, thou haſt not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned: Thou haſt covered with anger and perſecuted us, thou hast ſlaine, thou haſt not pitied,</hi> There Gods not pardoning them is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to be his plaguing them with temporal judgments.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Though God doth not wholly forbear to puniſh, or wholly take off the temporal puniſhment of ſinners, yet if he doth puniſh with lenity or moderation, or make ſome commutation of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (to uſe the term of the Civil Law) this ſaid moderating or commuting is ſaid to be Gods par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning: And no wonder; for it

How many of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have reaſon to call upon their ſouls to bleſſe God, who at once, or at the ſelf ſame time hath forgiven their ſins, and healed their diſeaſes, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.3. and for that reaſon to call not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon their ſouls, but alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their bodies and bones to praiſe God; as in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 35.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>If any one ſhall ask me whether I do blame our Divines for their uſuall diſtinguiſhing the ſufferings of the godly and the wicked by the names of chaſtiſements and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, albeit I think it our duty as neere as we can, to ſpeake Scripture ſenſe in Scripture words; nevertheleſſe, leſt I might ſeeme captious, I would not condemne
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170180:55"/>thoſe who have differenced them by the aforeſaid words; yet with theſe Salvoes and Proviſoes: 1. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that they impoſe not upon me or others, a neceſſity of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing them by thoſe names, as names diſtinct, or of diſtinct uſe and ſignification in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Provided that as I leave them to their libertie, ſo they leave me to my libertie, and not blame me, who ſhall chuſe rather to keep cloſe to the language, as wel as the ſenſe of Scripture in this matter, and to diſtinguiſh rather betwixt puniſhments and puniſhments, then betwixt chaſtiſements and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Provided, that under the foreſaid names, they vary not from the ſenſe of Scripture, making ſuch differences betweene the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the godly, and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as Scripture doth not make, or will not warrant; which laſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo is the rather conſiderable; becauſe there are ſome, I meane, not only Antinomians, but others alſo, who in their explication of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170180:55"/>the differences betwixt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements and puniſhments, doe difference them in ſuch ſort, as the Word of God wil not (for ought I know) allow. <hi>E.g.</hi> Undertaking to define, or ſtate the differences betwixt puniſhments properly and improperly ſo called (which latter they ſtile chaſtiſements) they tell us, that chaſtiſements are inflicted <hi>à Deo Patre,</hi> not <hi>Judice,</hi> by God not as a Judge, but as a Father. Whereas I think, that the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the godly, are inflicted by God both as a Father and as a Judge alſo, for why otherwiſe are ſuch ſufferings ſtiled judgments? or why elſe ſhould the Saints in ſo ſuffering, be ſaid (as indeed they are) to be judged of the Lord. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>ult. Iſa.</hi> 26.8. In ſtead therefore of ſaying that the ſufferings of the Saints are infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by God, <hi>Tanquam patre, non judice,</hi> I ſhould chooſe to ſay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Tanquam judice patrizante,</hi> they being paternall judgments, or fatherly puniſhments.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas ſome ſay that the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170180:56"/>puniſhments of the wicked are for ſin, but the chaſtiſements of the godly are from ſin; I find no ſuch difference warranted in the word, the contrary thereunto being plainly therein aſſerted, <hi>viz.</hi> that God doth puniſh the godly, for, or becauſe of their ſins. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 24.3. Surely at the command of the Lord, came this upon <hi>Judah,</hi> for the ſins of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and alſo for the innocent blood which he ſhed, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Howbeit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by this thy deede, thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven occaſion to the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme, the child alſo that is borne unto thee ſhall ſurely die.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. <hi>For this cauſe many are ſickly among you, and many ſleep. Rev.</hi> 2.4. <hi>I have ſomewhat to ſay unto thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt love.</hi> Yea I adde, that the temporal puniſhments of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are not only for, but alſo in ſome ſenſe from ſin, in that the uſe which they ought to make of them is their repentance and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unto which God doth as by lively voice cal them; for otherwiſe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170180:56"/>we cannot well conceive how the obſtinacy and impenitency of men ſhould be aggravated by Gods judgments. Thence that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>Mic,</hi> 7.9. <hi>Hear the red:</hi> yea, one ſpecial intent or end of Gods inflicting judgment on ſome wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men is, that all the wicked may take warning, or that they may heare and feare, and do no more ſo wickedly. <hi>Deut</hi> 17 23. thence did the heathen reſemble Gods judgments to thunder and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the end thereof being thus, <hi>viz. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t poena ad paucos, terror ad amnes perveniat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas ſome diſtinguiſh betwixt chaſtiſements and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſaying, that theſe do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the wrath and juſtice of God, but thoſê only from his love: I ſee no warrant for ſuch a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſeeing Scripture doth plainly tell us, that the ſufferings of the Saints are inflicted by an angry God, and by vertue of the juſtword and threatning of God. For what reaſon elſe were there for the Saints under ſufferings to acknowledge
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170180:57"/>the diſpleaſure and juſtice of God, as frequently we find they did, and according as it was (no doubt) their duty to doe. See <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13, 14. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.12, 13. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.33. And why elſe is the wrath of God ſaid to be kindled againſt his owne people, and in ſpecial againſt <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> the Saint of the Lord? <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.26. in ſtead therfore of ſaying that the ſufferings of the wicked are inflicted by Gods wrath and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but of the godly by his love; I ſhould chooſe to ſay, that the ſufferings of the wicked (compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively with the ſuffrings of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) do proceed from pure wrath &amp; juſtice; but the ſufferings of the godly from wrath and juſtice mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fatherly love and mercy: I ſay (comparatively with the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the godly) the ſufferings of the wicked doe proceede from pure wrath and juſtice; for if wee compare the ſufferings of the wicked here, with their ſufferings in hel, I ſuppoſe, that we cannot ſay, that their ſufferings here doe ſo purely proceed from Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or from his pure juſtice
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170180:57"/>in ſuch ſort, as doe their ſufferings in hell; and that for the reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, viz. becauſe their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and amendment is one gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and direct end of their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, of many of their ſufferings, at leaſt in this life. And becauſe what I have here delivered, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt by the Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: I ſhall endeavour to cleere and vindicate the ſame from their exceptions and objections, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Chriſt hath fully ſatisfied Gods juſtice, and how then can the ſufferings of the Saints proceed from his juſtice, or for ſin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The ſufferings of the Saints and Chriſts perfect ſatisfaction for ſin, are not incompoſſible, but may very wel ſtand together; the coexiſtance whereof, that it may the better appeare, the following anſwers are (to me) conſiderable, and as I hope, wil prove as to my ſelf, ſo to others, ſatisfactory.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Notwithſtanding the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the Saints are from Gods juſtice, yet are they not for the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170180:58"/>ſatisfaction of his juſtice in any ſuch ſenſe as Chriſts ſufferings were. Had the ſufferings of the Saints been inflicted by God, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them, for the ſatisfaction of divine juſtice in ſuch a ſenſe, the objection had been of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force, not otherwiſe. Now I ſay, the ſufferings of the Saints are not either inflicted by God, or endured by the Saints, to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Gods juſtice in any ſuch ſenſe, as wherein Scripture affirmes Chriſts ſufferings to be alone ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory, <hi>i. e.</hi> the ſufferings of the Saints are no part of that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or price, whereby a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation and attonement is made for ſin and ſinners. And let it be noted, that herein we differ from the Papiſts, who do make the ſufferings of the Saints in ſuch a ſenſe ſatisfactory to Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as whereby they derogate from the all-ſufficient ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The procurement of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Saints ſhould not at all ſuffer for their ſins
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170180:58"/>in this world, was not a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in or by the ſatisfaction of Chriſt; ſo that in calling into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion how farre forth, or unto what intents and preſent effects, the ſatisfaction of Chriſt was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by God and actually to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile. I ſay, in calling this into queſtion, we cannot reaſonably be thought to impeach the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſts ſatisfaction. And let it be obſerved, that I ſpeake concerning the effects and fruits of Chriſts ſatisfaction according to the intention of himſelf and of his Father. For albeit there be never ſo much intrinſecal worth or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue imaginable in the ſufferings of Chriſt, (I exclude not his active obedience from all ingrediency in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his merits) I conceive, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, that his ſufferings did not ſatisfie by a natural ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, but by reaſon of the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary compact, and agreement betwixt God and him, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that he ſatisfied for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intents and purpoſes, then were agreed upon betwixt them.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:170180:59"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did Chriſt by his ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction (according to compact betwixt him and his father) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and purchaſe for, or in behalf of the Saints?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Negatively, not an actual preſent immunity from all manner of ſuffering for their ſins, or that they ſhould be ſo farre priviledged as not at all, or in no ſort to be puniſhed for their ſins in this life; neither did Chriſt make or undertake to make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, neither did God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accept of his making or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to make ſatisfaction for any ſuch intent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Affirmatively, The Lord Chriſt by his ſatisfaction did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for the Saints a diſcharge and deliverance, (<hi>viz.</hi> at, in, or upon their believing, or when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come believers) from wrath to come, at the great day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. This he did procure as the direct end and fruit of his ſatisfaction, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or as a ſecond end he did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170180:59"/>for them a right unto, and in due time an actuall enjoyment of an inheritance eternall in the kingdome of heaven; God the Father being ſo over and above (as I may ſo ſay) wel pleaſed with his Sons ſatisfaction, as by reaſon thereof, not only to deliver the Saints from that wrath to come; the deſert whereof by ſin they had incurred; but moreover to grant unto them an immortall crowne and inheritance within the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory, which for degree, is commonly thought to be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter felicity then <hi>Adam,</hi> if he had ſtood, ſhould have attained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt by his ſatisfaction did procure for them the ſweetning, moderating and ſanctifying of all their ſufferings in this life, and the delivering of them from all thoſe curſed effects, which the ſaid ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are of themſelves apt to worke and occaſion, and which act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually they doe work or occaſion in the wicked; theſe evil and curſed effects of ſufferings being that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170180:60"/>from which Chriſt in the dayes of his fleſh, did pray to the Father to keepe the diſciples; but not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from ſuffering it ſelfe, no more then he prayed to God to take them out of the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.15. Briefly as Chriſt was a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſurety, and his Fathers free gift, ſo was his ſatisfaction (however moſt perfect, yet) a<note n="*" place="margin">In ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractly, was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, I meane, only this, viz. that it was free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily accepted by God the Father</note> refuſeable ſatisfation, if it be in it ſelfe, or in its abſtracted nature ſimply conſidered; and therfore as it was in Chriſts owne choice, whether or no to have made ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and in the Fathers choice whether or no to have accepted it (for God the Father might have choſen whether or no to have ſent his Son, and the Son might have choſen whether or no to have come into the world, and to have taken our fleſh) ſo may they chuſe how farre forth, or unto what intents and purpoſes this ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhall be paid and accepted; which ſaid intents, effects and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes are, and are not, as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, in the Negative and Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of my anſwer to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Queſtion.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:170180:60"/>
               <p n="3">3. I anſwer to the objection in the third place, that Gods being ſatisfied with Chriſts ſufferings, may be underſtood two waies,
<list>
                     <item>1. In reſpect of the ſurety and the value of his payment as being the full value of what his juſtice required, and more then which he required not at his hands.</item>
                     <item>2. In reſpect of the Debtour, the ſinner, and the effecting of his compleat and univerſal freedome: and in this latter reſpect, God was not upon, by, or with Chriſts ſatisfaction or payment, ſo well pleaſed or ſatisfied, as immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereupon to grant unto the ſinner a compleat, actual, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal freedom from all manner of ſuffering for ſin; the denying or not granting of which ſaid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, immediate and univerſall freedome, doth ariſe not from any imperfection in Chriſts ſatisfaction, which imperfection is to be made up by the ſufferings of the Saints, but from the mutuall compact betwixt the Father, and the Son, to have it otherwiſe to be, as is aforeſaid.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:170180:61"/>
               <p n="4">4. Or in anſwer to the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I may diſtinguiſh betwixt the ſatisfactory price, which Chriſt did pay for our redemption from all ſuffering for our ſinnes, and betwixt our enjoyment of the fruits and benefits of that ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory price, or ſaisfaction. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>viz</hi> the price paid by Chriſt, was moſt perfect; but our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the benefits fruits, or effects thereof, is not perfect preſently, and at once, we enjoying the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits thereof <hi>pedetentim,</hi> piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale, ſome at one time, ſome at another; ſome in this world, and ſome of them in the world to come. And I ſhall therefore add that the inflicting of temporall puniſhments upon the Saints for their ſins, or Gods not vouchſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a priviledge to the Saints as in no ſort to ſuffer for their ſins in this world; this I ſay, is no more againſt the perfection of Chriſts ſatisfaction, or Chriſts perfect ſatisfaction againſt it, then is Gods not perfect ſanctifying his people in this world; he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170180:61"/>the remainders of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to abide and worke in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſo long as they live in this mortal body.</p>
               <p>Whenſoever the Antinomians ſhall prove, that God is obliged by the perfection of Chriſts ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in no ſort to puniſh the Saints for their ſins in this world; they will prove that God is alike obliged, perfectly to ſanctifie, and immediately to glorifie the Saints at the firſt moment of their belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and converting; ſeeing the ſanctification and glorification of the Saints is as well a fruit, effect, and benefit of Chriſts perfect ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction as is their juſtification, or their freedome from any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> When God doth pardon a ſinner, he is ſaid to remember his ſins no more, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.17. And how then is it true, that God may, or doth puniſh the Saints, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict any ſuffering upon the Saints for their ſins?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have already declared in what ſenſe this expreſſion (Gods
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170180:62"/>not remembring the ſins of his people) cannot be underſtood; but becauſe this is ſo uſuall an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bjection with the Antinomians, and in their conceit a kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible <hi>Goliah;</hi> or as they mean, unanſwerable Argument;<note n="*" place="margin">I call the forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of injuries an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in men.

               <p>We are to know, that the phraſe is tranſlatitious or Metaphorical, wherin God is repreſented under a humane imperfection; which ſaid phraſe doth import, or hold forth ſome ſuch act or acts of grace in God towards thoſe that have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him, as do carry a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, proportion, or ſimilitude with thoſe acts of favour in men, expreſſed towards thoſe who have offended them, and whoſe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they are ſaid not to remember. Now that the ſimilitude and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance may not be ſtretched beyond the bounds of reaſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Scripture, I will ſet down,
<list>

               </p>
               <p>For the former. 1. God doth ſo farre remember the ſins of his people, as to be diſpleaſed with them, and to be incenſed againſt them. 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 11.27. <hi>Davids</hi> ſin in the matter of <hi>

               <p n="2">2. So farre as to checke and reprove them for their ſins, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he would have them take ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice that he doth remember them; and theſe reproofes God doth convey ſometimes in a moſt cutting and convincing way: for proof hereof, ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4. where the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is reproved for her declining.

               <p n="3">3. So farre as to threaten them with ſuffering for their ſins, and that, 1. Conditionally, except they repent, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do thy firſt works, or elſe

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170180:66"/>to other gracious ends, which God will actually effect thereby; mercy therein rejoycing (as I may ſo ſay) againſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Herein the revenge, which God taketh upon a penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is like to that revenge which a penitent ſinner doth ſometimes take upon himſelfe, which is not purely vindictive, but in part; it being upon the maine medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal and preventive, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.</p>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170180:67"/>and this being one ſpecial di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fference betwixt Jeſus Chriſt a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> and thoſe Prieſts which were after <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arons</hi> order, theſe being to offer daily ſacrifices as memorials of ſin, but he being to offer but one, and that one but once.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170180:72"/>Negative and Affirmative particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, where we have heard it ſet down, wherin the forgiveneſs of ſin doth, and wherein it doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; and in ſpecial, that it doth not conſiſt in taking away the fault of ſin, or ſin in the faultineſs therof. It is true, the fault is remitted: but how or in what ſenſe? <hi>viz.</hi> in reſpect of the puniſhment it ſelf, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to puniſhment, not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And as for that guilt, which is called <hi>Reatus culpae,</hi> guilt of fault, this we have heard is not taken away by remiſſion; but only that guilt which is called <hi>Reatus poenae,</hi> guilt of puniſhment. The School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of old, have much perplexed themſelves about theſe queſtions, what manner of act it is in God, whereby he doth remit ſin. And ſeeing the act of ſin is tranſient, what is it that is forgiven? Here they Anſwer, that ſin though <hi>praeteriit phyſicè,</hi> yet <hi>manet moraliter;</hi> though ſinne be paſt and gone in a phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, yet it remaines in a morall ſenſe; and though it be paſt in reſpect of the ſinful action, yet it
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170180:73"/>remaines in reſpect of its ſad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which ſad effects are done away, or taken away by pardon. But what theſe effects are, which by pardon are taken away, they have as touching that, been much divided in their opinion, making a great ſtirre about <hi>Macula,</hi> the ſpot or ſtaine of ſinne, in the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting whereof (as the Learned <hi>Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> relates) they have occupied themſelves for the ſpace of five hundred years, without any agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſatisfaction, as not able to declare what it is. But the truth is (as I think) and as hath been before laid down) that the ſad effects of ſinne, which remaining after the ſinful actions are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by a pardon, are the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſinner to puniſhment, and puniſhment it ſelfe; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being ſtiled by ſome of the Schoolmen, <hi>Relatio rationis, ſcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, ordinatio ad poenam.</hi> The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes conſidered, It appears, that there is no ſuch thing as the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the fault in contradiſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the remiſſion of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170180:73"/>&amp; that the ſaid diſtinction is a diſtinction without a difference.</p>
               <p>As an introduction to the Conſectaries next following, I think meet to give the Reader to underſtand, that it is a queſtion much debated among what kind of actions remiſſion of ſin is to be placed or accounted, whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe actions which are cals called immanent, or elſe among ſuch as are ſtiled tranſient. And againe, ſince actions tranſient are ſubdivided into actions ſtiled divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, and individual; it is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, whether forgiveneſſe of ſinne (if a tranſient action) be to be reckoned a dividual, or an individual action. Now as in <hi>chap.</hi> 22 <hi>Conſect.</hi> 16. I ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to manifeſt it to be a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient action, ſo by the four chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and conſectaries next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it will be manifeſted to be a dividual action, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch an action as hath its progreſſe <hi>[per partes]</hi> by degrees, and is not compleated at the ſelfe ſame inſtant; contrary to what is commonly received, it
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170180:74"/>being generally aſſerted as a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt Sanctification and remiſſion of ſin, that that is a dividual, but this an individual action. Now a tranſient acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being the ſame with the effect produced; and that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by remiſſion of ſinne, <hi>viz.</hi> the taking off of the obligation to puniſhment, and puniſhment it ſelf, being produced or taken off as it is laid on. <hi>viz. per partes,</hi> by degrees <hi>viz.</hi> as new ſins are committed; it ſeems to me evidently apparent, that remiſſion of ſin is not an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, but a dividual action, and as wil appeare by the Conſectaries next following.</p>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170180:81"/>conſideration, in order to the converting of all ſuch from the errour of their way in that behalf. Be it then conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in that Petition we pray, that in the great day of judgment we may find mercy with God (which I ſtiled pardon of ſinne in a ſignal ſenſe) according to the tenour of the Apoſtles prayer for <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18.

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Believers have already
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170180:82"/>the pardon of their ſinnes, and God in Chriſt is ſaid to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready forgiven them their treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. and 2.13. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>laſt.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.

Thus God is ſaid to have given that grace to the elect, before the world began, which at that time hee did onely purpoſe infallibly to give in due time. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I have already proved that the Saints in this life are forgiven but in part, and not fully.

               <p n="1">1. Becauſe in part they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaved and pardoned; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and ſalvation is already begun in and upon them.</p>

So ſoone as God hath made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of any bleſſing, whether tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or ſpiritual to a believer, a believer (I conceive) hath right unto it; (in which ſenſe we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly expound that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>all things are yours,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. laſt) but what of that? is not a believer therefore to pray for the actuall enjoyment of what God hath promiſed?

May God be pleaſed of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercy to enlighten and reduce them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be it conſidered, that in the ſaid fifth Petition of the Lords prayer, we pray for forgiveneſſe of ſinne, not only as to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after death, but alſo in this life, <hi>i.e.</hi> that preſent judgments which our ſinnes might deſervedly bring upon us may be prevented,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170180:84"/>ſuſpended, moderated, or if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, may be ſhortned, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, removed, ſanctified, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to our benefit: for in theſe things (as hath been already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated) doth conſiſt partly the forgiveneſſe of ſinne. Now what intelligent Chriſtian is there, who will not acknowledge, that they have need of ſuch things as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the preventing, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating, removing, ſanctifying of temporall judgements and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be it conſidered, That as the Saints doe ſinne daily more or leſſe; ſo their new ſinns do bring a new obligation to puniſhment (or elſe they could not be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſinners, neither could they be pardoned, as needing no pardon) which ſaid obligation they have need ſhould be taken off by a particular pardon, beſides their firſt general pardon (for that any ſinne is pardoned afore it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, I ſhal at large diſprove in another Conſectary;) for which ſaid particular pardon a believer
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170180:85"/>is according to his neede to pray to God, hee having no aſſurance from God to obtaine either it, or ought elſe without prayer; ſuch cauſe have wee to give the like counſel to the beſt among the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as <hi>Simon Peter</hi> did to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Repent, and pray to God, that thy daily ſinnes may be forgiven thee.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. Be it conſidered (which I think will generally be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged) that the ſinnes of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers after converſion, ſpecially their more groſſe, falſe, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent backſlidings, doe ſubject them meritoriouſly, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the law, and to the<note n="*" place="margin">Elſe why doth God threaten them upon their back ſliding with the forfeiture of their former par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>don? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6, 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. <hi>lat.</hi> See Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>p.</hi> 242, 243.</note> forfeiture of that right which they had to the pardon of former ſins by vertue of the Covenant; and that theſe new ſinnes do not <hi>de facto</hi> condemne a believer, is to be aſcribed to the Lord Chriſt, by whoſe blood wee have an entrance into the Covenant of grace, and a ſtanding, or continuance in it by his interceſſion. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.24. by which

               <p>Now have not believers need to pray to God that he would not take that advantage of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of former pardon, as juſtly hee might doe? Yea, is it not neceſſary that they ſhould ſo doe, as ever they doe expect that hee ſhould not take the advantage of the ſaid forfeiture? For conſider, that as Jeſus Chriſt doth intercede in heaven for the continuance of remiſſion of ſinne in the behalfe of the Saints, ſo hee doth intercede, and actually procure for them all ſuch grace or graces, as without which their pardon ſhall not be continued; thence is he ſaid to be exalted by God, not only to give to Iſrael remiſſion, but alſo repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, not the former without the latter; yea, firſt repentance for ſin, and then remiſſion of it. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31 Now what ground hath any belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to hope for the continuance of

               <list>
                  <item>1. Remiſsion of ſinne being a grace or benefit purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt, as our adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and regeneration are, why ſhould it be thought more ſtrange that we are not fully made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of remiſsion afore the day of judgment, then of adoption and regeneration? And yet the truth is here, and ſo it muſt bee there alſo acknowledged, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we are adopted and regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo ſoone as we are believers, nevertheleſſe the time of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption and regeneration is not in ſome ſenſe afore the day of judgment, becauſe afore that time they ſhall not be compleated in ſoul and body, nor the benefits of them as to the whole man fully enjoyed, as appeares <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.26.</item>
                  <item>2. The reinveſtment, or reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſinner into the love and favour of God, being (as was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid) the poſitive part of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, who will ſay to the contrary, but that a ſinner may grow in the love and favour of God, and that

               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. How farre forth, or in what ſenſe may it be ſaid, that a ſinner doth receive a preſent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don immediately upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his ſinnes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though this queſtion be a different queſtion from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and hath more difficulty in it; nevertheleſſe a due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the premiſes touching the quiddity, or true nature of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſinne, will enable us to make an unerring anſwer (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) thereunto, and unto the ſaid queſtion: Therefore I reply, That a ſinner in, or upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of his ſinnes, doth inſtantly enjoy the pardon of his ſins three wayes, or in a threefold ſenſe, or for as much as doth amount to theſe three things.</p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:170180:88"/>
               <p n="1">1. The ſinner is immediately diſcharged, delivered, or diſobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from that <hi>Wrath to come</hi> (as is the Apoſtles phraſe, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10.) or from being actually bound over to eternal damnation; or, the condemning power of ſin is taken away, or (in the phraſe of the Prophet <hi>Micah, chap.</hi> 7.19.) ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued. As ſin hath a commanding power over the ſinner, enſlaving him to its ſervice, ſo likewiſe it hath a condemning power upon the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which power is immediately taken away, ſo ſoon as ſin is (in a Scripture ſenſe, way, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) confeſſed.</p>
               <p>Having mentioned theſe two powers of ſin, let me crave leave to interpoſe this one thing (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and by the by;) <hi>viz,</hi> That when we read in the writings of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> or in any other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concerning the reign and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſin, we muſt have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial regard to the Context, if we will rightly interpret the true meaning of the Holy Ghoſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which of theſe two pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170180:89"/>of ſin he ſpeaketh: for I am half minded, that ſome Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are commonly interpreted one way, when upon a more through conſideration wee ſhall find reaſon rather to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret them another, eſpecially that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>[Sin ſhall not have dominion over you,]</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly interpreted concerning the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding power of ſin, &amp; I think is intended by the Apoſtle concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the damning power thereof, that power or ſtrength which hee elſewhere ſaith, ſin hath by the Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> the commination of the Law, by vertue whereof ſin doth damn or condemn the ſinner, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. and for victory over which ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <list>
                  <item>1. That when God doth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſin, hee is ſaid to ſubdue it <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.19.</item>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:170180:89"/>
                  <item>2.

                  <item>3. That Gods not ſuffering ſin in reſpect of its damning power to reign over the Saints, is a very fit proper and prevalent Argument, to perſwade them not to ſuffer ſin in reſpect of its commanding pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to reign over them. Freedom from both theſe powers of ſin, or from ſin with reſpect to both theſe powers (it being ſtiled with reſpect to its commanding power over us, the Law of ſin; and with reſpect to its damning power over us, the Law of Death) the Apoſtle doth mention in one place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. <hi>The Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> the living or quickning Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>hath made me free from the law of ſin and</hi>

                     <hi>deah; i. e.</hi> from ſin, which doth as a Law command &amp; condemn This laſt particular being conſidered, doth make me boldly, yet humbly, to offer this as a rule; <hi>viz.</hi> That when God doth exhort us, not to ſuffer ſin to have dominion over us, then and there we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the commanding power of ſin; but when he promiſeth on his part, that ſin ſhall not have dominion over us, then and there we are to underſtand the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power of ſin, the former be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing mans duty, is fit matter for a command; the latter being Gods mercy is fit matter for a Promiſe. Yet let me add theſe two things in the way of Caution.

                        <item>1.

What law it is, by vertue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the ſinnes of believers do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170180:96"/>damnation, is not ſo unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly by Divines agreed upon; it being a queſtion agitated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, whether the old law, or covenant of works, be only relaxed, or whether it be not abrogated to all mankind. For my owne part, I can ſcarce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne any real difference in this controverſie, one chooſing to ſtile that an Abrogation, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thinks fitteſt (with a preciſe reſpect to the rule of the civil law) to call a Relaxation; and it being my opinion, that the controverſie is rather verball, then real, I hope therefore, that I may without the offence, and with the good leave of either partie expreſſe my ſenſe in the ſame to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> I humbly conceive, that whereas in the old law or covenant of works, all manner of ſinne was threatned with death, as unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>ex parte legis,</hi> that law as threatning death in ſuch ſort, and upon ſuch terms, and as command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfect, univerſal obedience, as the only condition of life, is taken
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170180:96"/>away; ſo that mankind is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that law or covenant, as in the ſenſe aforeſaid; in ſtead whereof, wee all are <hi>Sub lege remediante,</hi> under a new law, or covenant of the Lord Redeemer: in which law there are threatnings of two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Conditional and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; in the former, all manner of ſinne being threatned with damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in the latter only final im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitencie and unbeliefe. But it is not material to my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to determine ought in that queſtion, it being ſufficient for mee only to ſay, that all Proteſtant Divines do unanimouſly accord in this, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That all ſin is in its owne nature mortal, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves damnation, by vertue of the threatning of one law or another, either the new, or elſe the old (threatning in that reſpect, or ſo farre forth) being in force, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing.</p>

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170180:97"/>of ſinne, is actually obliged to ſuffer accordingly: for why, or whence is ſinne ſaid to be mortal, but from that ſtrength which it hath from, or by the vertue of the lawes commination to oblige the ſinner to damnation?</p>
               <p n="3">3. As a conſequent hereof it followes, that a ſinner hath neede of pardon for every ſinne, that ſo the penalty of the law may not be executed according to the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In order to the procuring of the ſaid pardon or diſ-obligation, and to the diverting of damnation threatned; it is neceſſary, that the godly ſhould uſe ſuch meanes from time to time as God hath in his word commanded them to uſe; <hi>i. e.</hi> that they ſhould confeſs their ſinnes, pray for the pardon of them, flie for refuge by faith to the blood of Chriſt dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Immediately upon a ſinners taking ſuch a courſe, or uſing ſuch meanes as God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to take and uſe for pardon,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170180:97"/>the law is diſabled, and the ſinner is diſobliged from damnation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its threatning is only condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, <hi>viz.</hi> in caſe of non-repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and faith, which conditions being performed, the new law, or covenant can no longer hold the ſinner guilty.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This diſobligation of the ſinner is that particular and new pardon, of which, as was aſſerted, a godly man hath need, in reſpect of his new and particular ſinnes. I am not ignorant that ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines doe not uſe in this caſe, the expreſſion (new and particular pardon) but (a renewed applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of pardon.) But becauſe this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is to my ſeeming very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, (they not explicating what they doe intend by the ſaid renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed application of pardon, whether they meane ſome renewed act of the ſinner, or elſe ſome renewed act of God; and becauſe I know no fitneſſe in the phraſe in what ſenſe ſoever it be taken) for if any one alledge the former ſenſe I anſwer, That pardon of ſin (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170180:98"/>taken, is not our act, but Gods. Beſides, A ſinners renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed application of pardon to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, is his renewed act or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of faith (which act of faith I ſhould chuſe to expreſſe, by a ſinners renewed application of himſelf to Chriſt, or the Promiſes of Chriſt for pardon, and not by the ſinners renewed application of pardon to himſelfe.) If any ſhall alledge the latter ſenſe; I anſwer, That Gods application of pardon is pardon; or, Gods renewed application of pardon is neither more nor leſſe but plainly this, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods beſtowing a new pardon, or (in the phraſe of the Prophet <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah, chap.</hi> 55.7.) his <hi>multiplying to pardon,</hi> or his pardoning again and again.) Theſe things (I ſay) conſidered, I have thought meet to forbear the uſe of that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion [A renewed application of pardon.] and in ſtead thereof to ſay, [New pardons.]</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant likewiſe, that ſome Divines in ſtead of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, [There is an actual obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170180:98"/>of the ſinner by, or immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the commiſſion of ſin, to damnation;] they ſometimes ſay [There is an aptitude in all ſin to damn the ſinner;] which phraſe as being more mollifying, it was once in my thoughts to have uſed, and accordingly to have expreſſed Gods particular and new pardons, by his hindring or obſtructing the foreſaid aptitude of ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and new ſins, from taking ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the actual obligation of a ſinner to damnation. But upon a due conſideration of this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I found (as I thought, and ſtill do think) juſt cauſe to wave and decline the uſe of it; that expreſſion being as much as to ſay, I ſhould have fallen out, if I had not been reconciled; or, I ſhould have been wounded, if I had not been healed; or, I had been bound and tyed, if I had not been looſed and untyed; or, a ſinner ſhould have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to ſuffer, if he had not been pardoned. Theſe two laſt phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (I confeſſe) in a ſenſe are true, and for that purpoſe may be uſed;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170180:99"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> I had been <hi>ſtill</hi> bound, and tyed, if I had not been loſed and untyed; or, A ſinner ſhould have been <hi>ſtill</hi> obliged to ſuffer, if he had not been pardoned; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, that time was, when the ſinner or perſon now looſed, unti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pardoned, was actually tied, bound, and obliged to ſuffer: Nevertheleſſe, without the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of a ſinners precedaneous actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al obligation to ſuffer, the foreſaid expreſſions are intolerable; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe pardon doth not prevent the ſinners obligation to ſuffer, no more then healing doth prevent wounding or looſing doth prevent binding, but alwayes followes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it in order of Nature at leaſt, if not in time, as the remedy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The premiſes being duly weighed, I can perceive no juſt cauſe why any perſon, under what pretence ſoever, ſhould bee offended for my aſſerting, as is before aſſerted; <hi>viz.</hi> That new ſins do bring a new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to puniſhment, which obligation muſt bee diſſolved,

               <p>As to the former, I grant that at what time God did will or purpoſe to pardon any one ſinne, yea any one elect ſinner he did at that inſtant time will, or purpoſe to pardon all and every ſin all and every ſinner, and this hee did will and purpoſe from all eternity: for Gods will or purpoſe being his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, it cannot therefore be ſaid, that hee did ever begin to will or purpoſe any thing.</p>

In the way of exception, I ſhall lay downe this in the firſt place, and as in general, <hi>viz.</hi> It will not follow from any, or all the ſaid propoſitions, whether ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally or jointly taken, that all ſins and ſinners are actually pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at once; no more then it will follow, that becauſe a Father did purpoſe an inheritance for his child afore it was borne; or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe for his child an inheritance as ſoone as it was borne, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the ſaid inheritance as ſoone as it could ſpeak and underſtand, that the child did therefore at, or from the time of the ſaid purpoſe, purchaſe, or promiſe actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, or was made actual poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour of the ſaid inheritance. And becauſe it is a very common and foule errour; yea, a mother-er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170180:102"/>(as I may ſo ſay) in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians, not to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the decree, or will of God, and the execution thereof, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Gods purpoſes &amp; his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. Be it therfore conſidered,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That albeit this propoſition [God did not will or decree any thing in time] be a true propoſition, referring [in time] to his wil or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; nevertheleſs the contrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition [God did wil or decree e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing in time] is true, [refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in time] to the being, or actual exiſtence of the thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As God did from eternity will or purpoſe the beginning of the thing; <hi>e. g.</hi> the creation of the world (though he never did begin to will it, having will'd it from ternity) ſo he alſo from eternity did will or purpoſe the ceaſing of things, <hi>e. g.</hi> the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the world; both theſe God did will at once. Will it therefore follow, that the world was created and diſſolved from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and both created and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved at once?</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:170180:103"/>
               <p n="3">3. God did purpoſe from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity to ſanctify and glorifie his Elect, yea at what time he did will their birth, he did will their new birth; at what time he did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to give them life on earth, he did purpoſe to give them life in Heaven: Wil it therefore follow, That the Elect are ſanctified and glorified actually from eternity, or borne againe ſo ſoone as borne, or glorified ſo ſoone as ſanctified?</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Things are otherwiſe to God then they are to us, and therefore what is not from eternity in reſpect of us, may be from eternity in reſpect of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw</hi> In reſpect of actual exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, things are to God no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then they are to us; <hi>i. e.</hi> God doth not ſee or know any thing actually to be or exiſt, afore it actually is, or doth exiſt: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be true, that he doth fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know in theſe things what we do not, and cannot; <hi>viz.</hi> That a thing ſhall be, or ſhall exiſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it actually is, or doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt.</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:170180:103"/>
               <p n="2">2. As it is the power of God which makes a thing poſſible, and the pleaſure or will of God, that makes a thing future; ſo it is the application of his power by his will and pleaſure to the production of this or that, which doth make it actually to be, or doth make it of poſſible and future, to become actually exiſtent.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p>I deſire the Reader, that the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170180:104"/>ſeveral anſwers to the foreſaid Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection may the rather bee well weighed and remembred, becauſe they ſerve to make void and null one ſpecial Argument of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians, whereby they would prove actual Juſtification before faith: (this being the ſcope of a late Book written by Mr. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Eyre</hi> of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Benjamin Woodbridg</hi> of <hi>Newbery;</hi> it being, as it now appears, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> his lot to have among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the ſon and ſucceſſour of his learned School-maſter Mr. <hi>John Woodbridg</hi> (my worthy Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour) his declared Adverſaries in that and in ſome other points, as depending on it, or it on them:) to make void (I ſay) an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſaid purpoſe taken out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. it being there aſſerted, <hi>That God doth call the things which be not, as though they were,</hi> therefore (ſay they) though we are not, yet we are ſaid to be juſtified in the ſight of God, as if we were. But be it knowne, that the import or reaſon of that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-ſaying
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170180:104"/>is not becauſe things are <hi>in actu entitative,</hi> that things do exiſt or have an exiſtence as to God, or before God, though they have no exiſtence in themſelves, or as to us; but becauſe God doth foreſee that things will be, or will exiſt, before they are or do exiſt, which no humane eye can foreſee; (for which cauſe he is ſaid to <hi>Foreſee the Juſtification of the Heathen through faith,</hi> Gal. 3.8. The Scripture foreſeeing; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Holy Ghoſt the Authour of the Scripture foreſeeing (as <hi>Piſcator</hi> interprets the place) that God would juſtifie the heathen through faith) as alſo, becauſe God can do thoſe things by his power, which we cannot do, yea, which (I do not ſay, <hi>in</hi> nature, but) as <hi>to</hi> nature are impoſſible to be done; and that he can do theſe things at any time, whenſoever he ſhall by his will and pleaſure apply his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent power for the effecting thereof, as was manifeſted in the caſe of <hi>Sarah</hi> there ſpecified. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid, That God doth foreſee
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170180:105"/>thoſe things which we do not, and that he is ſaid for that cauſe, to <hi>call the things that are not, as though they were.</hi> I ſhall exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that ſaying in one inſtance; <hi>e. g.</hi> The only wiſe God did foreſee the diſſolution of the late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even afore the convention of it, albeit as it ſeems Mr <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Eyre</hi> did not foreſee it a few dayes before it was diſſolved; for if he had foreſeen, that that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have been ſo ſoone diſſolved upon account of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no longer profitable for the Commonwealth, doubtleſſe hee would not have told them (as to their faces) in his Epiſtle Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory unto them, That they were in his judgment, the fitteſt of any company of men on earth, to um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and judg in the points contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted betwixt him and Mr. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg.</hi> Had Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> in very deed delivered the truth of his judgment and the judgment of truth in that ſuffrage ſuper-ſuperlative, I muſt have ſaid, That it had been a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pities that the ſaid company
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170180:105"/>of men, though diſſolved as to a Parliament of the Commonwealth (both name and thing;) yet had not been continued under ſome new name; <hi>e. g. Apollinis tripos; Conceſſus Apoſtolicus, Aarons Breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands Oracle, The Church Vertual,</hi> or the like <hi>Notio ſecunda;</hi> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom all diſſenting perſons and parties, both in our own, and in all the Nations throughout the world might have had recourſe for reſolution in the great things and truthes of God. But ſeeing that it was concluded by themſelves, that their company ſo conſtituted, was no longer profitable to the Commonwealth, I believe that Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> is now convicted, that their longer ſitting was not like to be profitable for the Church; whereupon I ſhall conclude, that it was for want of foreſight, that Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> did ſo far luxuriate in their high praiſes, as to ſay, That of any company of men on earth, they were the fitteſt to umpire in ſuch Theological Diſputes as
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170180:106"/>are betwixt him and his old School fellow Mr. <hi>Benjamin Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the ſecond Negative Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition be this; <hi>viz. No ſin is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually pardoned, till a perſon bee made capable of it, or put into a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of receiving or enjoying it.</hi> This Propoſition carries its owne evidence in the body or bowels of it: for nothing is before it can be. I ſhall therefore immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my ſelf to the reſolution of the following Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>When is a perſon capable of receiving the actual pardon of his ſins?</hi> Or, <hi>When are the Elect ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving, or actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying that pardon which was ſo long ſince purpoſed, purchaſed, promiſed to and for them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. When they need it.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>When do they need it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> When they are, or do become ſinners, have committed ſin, or are guilty of ſin. Till ſin be paſt, pardon is to come. To pardon ſin before it is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170180:106"/>is to pardon ſin that is no ſin, it is to pardon that which is not, which is a contradiction, and a meere impoſſibility: for where there is no guilt, there can be no pardon. As a man is not capable of an Almes, till he be miſerable and indigent; ſo nor of pardon, till he be peccant: Or as a man is not capable of a cure by Phyſick and Chyrurgery till he be ſick and wounded; ſo nor of pardon, till he be ſick of ſin, and wounded by it. Theſe ſimilitudes are the rather apt, becauſe Gods pardoning ſin is ſaid to be <hi>his taking compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on us,</hi> (<hi>Mic.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 13. <hi>God compaſſionate me a ſinner,</hi> ſaith the Publican:) and his <hi>healing us, Iſai.</hi> 53.5. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.4. This is a remote capacity. The next par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular doth declare and ſet forth the ſinners proximous, or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate capacity of pardon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then are the Elect capable of actual pardon, when they are in Gods way fit or fitted for it.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>When is that?</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> When they ſee their ſins (I ſpeak of perſons adult, or of ripe age) confeſſe them, repent for them, believe in Chriſt. See <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſſe, that whoſoever beleeveth in him ſhall receive remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins.</hi> Luke 24.47. <hi>And that repentance and remiſſion of ſin ſhould be preached in his name among all Nations.</hi> Acts 5.31. <hi>Him hath God exalted, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Iſrael and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin,</hi> (obſerve, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is given firſt, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.) As the ground is not capable of receiving the ſeed of the Husbandman till it be plowed, ſo nor are the Elect capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the precious ſeed of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, till the fallow ground of their hearts be plowed up by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance (to ſpeak in the meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> chap. 4.4.) In this ſenſe that ſaying of the Evangeliſt is moſt true, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as by ſome it is interpreted; <hi>John</hi> 1.16. <hi>Of his fulneſſe we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and grace for grace; i. e.</hi> by
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170180:107"/>reaſon of one grace we receive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (even as the God of all grace doth give one grace in order to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother) <hi>e g.</hi> for, or by reaſon of the grace of faith, repentance and converſion (all which were merited by Chriſt) God gives us the grace of Remiſſion, according to that Proverbial ſaying among the Jewes, and in this caſe applia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Habenti dabitur.</hi> As God doth by Grace adapt, or make us fit and meet for glory, (Col. 1.12 <hi>Giving thanks to the Father, who hath made us meet for the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among the Saints in light,</hi>) So by one grace God doth make us meet for receiving of another. And as the Wedding Garment did fit and make meet the Gueſts for the Wedding Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; ſo doth Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and new obedience (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Wedding Garment) fit, or make meet the ſinner for partaking in the pardon of his ſins, which is as the Wedding Supper.</p>

               <p>This particular is the rather to be obſerved, becauſe it is uſeful, as otherwiſe, ſo ſpecially for theſe two purpoſes.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To prevent and redreſſe the preſumption of impenitent and ungodly ſinners, who are apt to expect to reap where they have not ſowed, <hi>and to gather where they have not ſtrawed.</hi> I mean, who do uſually expect an harveſt of comfort in the pardon of their ſins, and to reape in mercy, when they have not ſowen to themſelves one ſeed (the leaſt muſtard ſeed) of grace, or one graine of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe (to ſpeak in the phraſe of the prophet, <hi>Hoſ. ch.</hi> 10.12)</item>
                  <item>2. It is uſeful, whereby to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate or anſwer the common obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Antinomians, wherby they would involve us as guilty of impeaching the freedom of Gods grace in the pardon of our ſins, becauſe we affirme with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that pardon of ſinne can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not actually be enjoyed without the performance of ſuch and ſuch
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170180:108"/>conditions, the performance of which ſaid conditions is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of, and cannot be without Gods free grace given to us, and enabling us for that end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. I ſhall cloſe this particular with the words of that very Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and godly man, Mr. <hi>Anthony Burges,</hi> in his book of juſtification, <hi>p.</hi> 18. There goe more cauſes to the pardon of ſin beſides the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe; faith the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cauſe, which is as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in its kind for this great benefit as the meritorious cauſe is in its kind; that though Chriſt hath born ſuch a mans ſins, yet they are not pardoned till he doe believe; for as the grace of God (which is the efficient cauſe of pardon) doth not make a ſinne compleatly forgiven without the meritorious cauſe, ſo neither doth the meritorious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the inſtrumental, but there is a neceſſity of the preſence and the cooperation of all theſe.</item>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This objection is a very
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170180:110"/>weak one, and for the weakneſſe thereof, I may well ſtile it a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans objection: and I ſhall the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo ſtile it, becauſe it was in very deed, the objection which a certaine woman in theſe parts (much perverted, as it ſeems, by Antinomian principles, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting as I have heard, the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings of ſuch teachers as are ſent abroad by the Church of <hi>Abbing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>) objected in my hearing againſt the truth here aſſerted by mee, <hi>viz</hi> that all ſins, paſt, preſent and to come, are not pardoned at once; and albeit the ſaid Siſter did expreſſe as much confidence in her opinion to the contrary, as if ſo be ſhee had beene inſpired with a ſpirit infallible, and did receive ſo little ſatisfaction by my anſwers, as that ſhe did plainly tell me to my face, that my anſwers did make it apparent unto her, that I was a perſon not as yet juſtified; I ſhall nevertheleſſe ſet downe in this place the ſelf ſame anſwers, and no other anſwer then what
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170180:110"/>I made unto her objection as now followes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I told her that ſhee might by a like reaſon infer, that Chriſt Jeſus is not a perfect Red emer, ſeeing the Saints are not in this life perfectly redeemed from their ſins, but muſt waite for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment thereof till the day of judgement, which for that cauſe is ſtiled the day of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I asked her whether ſhee would aſſert her ſelfe to be a Saint already in heaven, actually ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Halelujah;</hi> Shee anſwered no. Whereupon I told her, that the glorification of believers, is the fruit or benefit of Chriſts ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and I had therefore as good reaſon upon this account to make the ſame objection againſt her, <hi>viz</hi> that then Chriſt was not a perfect ſatisfier.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Finally I told her, that ſhee is carefully to diſtinguiſh betwixt the price which Chriſt paid for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, or for our remiſſion,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170180:111"/>ranſom or redemption, and betwixt the fruits, effects and benefits which the Saints do enjoy therby; The former I told her was a price moſt perfect, but the latter are not all at once in perfection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us, but by degrees, and in Gods due time and way, ſome now, ſome then, ſome in this life, ſome at death, and ſome not afore the day of judgement.</p>
               <p>Theſe anſwers I then thought, and ſtil do think ſatisfactory, but I doe find, that the confidence of a woman poſſeſſed with Antinomian principles, is inſuperable The Lord in his great mercy pity thoſe who are under ſtrong deluſions, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in lies, and put ſome reſtraint upon ſuch teachers as are purpoſely ſent forth under pretence of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating the Goſpel, to adulterate and corrupt it, and to make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of the ſouls of the ſimple, whom with good words and fair ſpeeches, they do moſt pitifully and impiouſly beguile.</p>

               <p>I have already proved, That God is ſaid ſometimes to forgive the ſins of wicked men; as alſo, That Gods puniſhing is ſaid to be his not forgiving, and his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving his not puniſhing; ſo that the ſaid Propoſitions, being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their latitude as they ſound, cannot ageee with the truth of Scripture: which that they may do, it is neceſſary that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and reſtrain them unto that kind of forgiveneſſe, which doth reſpect the diſobliging or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of a ſinner from eternal damnation; for which reſpect, and indeed for the prevention of much miſtake in this Subject, I
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170180:112"/>ſhould think it expedient for any one who undertaketh to write more at large concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of forgiveneſſe of ſin, to ſet downe almoſt in the firſt place, this diſtinction; <hi>viz.</hi> There is a twofold forgiveneſſe of ſin plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed in Scripture; the one peculiar to the Saints, which for that cauſe may well be ſtiled The remiſſion of Gods Elect, as for a like cauſe faith is ſtiled by the Apoſtle, <hi>the faith of Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,</hi> as <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1. The other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Reprobate with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170180:113"/>of reaſon, how to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret all his ſayings and aſſertions in a true ſenſe; and for that cauſe it was once in my mind to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted the meaning of that Propoſition of his (<hi>p.</hi> 21. <hi>When a ſin is forgiven, it is totally and perfectly forgiven.</hi>) rather then to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared my diſſent from it. I ſay, it was in my mind to have interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that Propoſition, as barely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a ſinners diſcharge, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obligation from eternal damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I doubt not, was the meaning of that worthy Author, even as he ſeems to explicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſaying, <hi>p.</hi> 49. <hi>God pardeneth ſin and removeth the guilt of it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and perfectly, ſo that a ſin can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more pardoned then it is, it is as abſolutely forgiven as can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, it can be no better pardoned, then if we were in heaven.</hi> But upon conſideration I found a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to declare my diſſent from him in that Propoſition, together with its explanations: for the ſins of the Elect are not in this life par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned at all<note n="*" place="bottom">Though the ſins of the Elect are actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this life, yet not abſolutely as to the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancewher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is not abſolutely promiſed, but upon condition of their Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> abſolutely (as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170180:113"/>from eternal damnation) and therefore I ſee no juſt reaſon, why any one ſhould ſay with Mr. <hi>Burges, That they are pardoned as abſolutely as can be deſired:</hi> and if abſolute and conditional do vary the degrees of perfection (as for ought I know they do) I ſee no warrant to ſay, <hi>That when God pardons a ſin, he doth it perfectly:</hi> Its true, God doth it perfectly, ſo far as upon grounds of reaſon and Religion the Saints can expect or deſire to have it done in this life; <hi>viz.</hi> conditionally upon their perſeverance in Grace: yet not ſo perfectly, becauſe not ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, as when they come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

                  <item>4. Albeit Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelfe hath endeavoured to clear it, and it is not my purpoſe to contradict him in ought that he hath ſaid in that behalf; nevertheleſſe I think it expedient, that there ſhould more be added for clearing the point: for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> defining remiſſion of ſin to be a diſſolving or taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the obligation to puniſhment (not at all mentioning the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al taking away of puniſhment it ſelf, but leaving that, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

               </list>
               <p>Now for the better cleering of the point in hand, I ſhall ſet down in the firſt place, what an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and tranſient action is, and what is the difference betwixt
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170180:116"/>them; and to that end it will bee expedient to have recourſe unto what Phyloſophical Authors in their metaphyſical Divinity have ſaid in the ſame; and in ſpecial I ſhall ſet downe the Deſcriptions which the acute and learned <hi>Schei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler</hi> gives of them, <hi>Met. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 233, 234, 235. <hi>Actio immanens dicitur ab immanendo, quod ſcilicet in agente maneat, quod tamen intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligendum eſt non poſitive, ſed nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; nempe, Actio immanens qua talis eſt, eſt in agente hoc ſenſu, quia non tranſit ad patiens; in ipſo autem agente non eſt per modum adjuncti, ſeu per poſitivam inhaerentiam in ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, ſed ſimpliciter ad ipſum compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur ut ad cauſam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Explication is the rather to be minded, becauſe in this ſenſe only can wee attribute an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent action to God; <hi>viz.

                  </note> did very wel, (having ſaid, that thoſe who ſpeake of immanent acts in God by [immanent in God] muſt needs meane Negatively, not Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively) to adde this as the reaſon thereof, ſaying, for acts have not the reſpect of an adjunct to its ſubject, but of an effect to its cauſe. Where (by the way) let me crave leave to give notice to the Reader, that I cannot but wonder at <hi>Mr. Kendals</hi> haſte and overſight, ſo much to miſtake <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> as to charge him for rendring that as a reaſon of one thing, which hee plainly renders as a reaſon of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it in as a reaſon why immanent acts cannot be aſcribed unto God poſitively, but negatively: [for acts have not the reſpect of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct to its ſubject, but of an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to its cauſe.) Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> doth argue againſt him, as if hee had rendred that as a reaſon of his following conjecture, that hee thinks it beyond our underſtanding
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170180:117"/>to know certainly, that all Gods immanent acts are eternal.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>E.g.</hi> Whereas <hi>Mr. Kendal</hi> excepts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> ſaying that acts have the reſpect not of an effect to its cauſe, but of a cauſe to its effects. <hi>Mr. Kendal</hi> might have done well to have more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred (for hee being an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher as well as a Divine, doth know it very wel) be difference betwixt <hi>cauſe cauſalitas, &amp; cauſatum,</hi> actions being [to ſpeake preciſely] <hi>cauſalitates;</hi> which cauſalities, as they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the effect wrought, have the name and reſpect of cauſes, but as they do reſpect the Agent, they have the reſpect and name of effect; herein the common ſaying in Logick being verified, <hi>unaeademque respoteſt ad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſa referri argumenta.</hi>
                  </note> More I think might juſtly be ſpoken to vindicate Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> againſt what Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> hath with ſuch acrimony of ſtile written a gainſt him: but as they ſaid concerning the blind man, ſo may I well ſay in this place concerning one eagle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyed, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is of age, let him ſpeake for himſelfe. For my owne part, though I look upon Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> as worthy of much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, not only as a very Godly and Learned Divine, but as one alſo who hath deſerved very well of the Churches of God for his great and worthy pains againſt <hi>Mr. John Goodwin;</hi> nevertheleſſe I cannot but ſay of him as he ſaid of <hi>Mr. Baxter, viz. Mr. Kendal</hi> having told him that hee did ill conſult his owne honour in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170180:117"/>in ſome points, thoſe two famous Divines <hi>Dr. Twiſſe,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Pemble</hi>) that <hi>Mr. Kendal</hi> hath ill conſulted his owne honor by writing in ſuch a ſort againſt <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> in that ſheet of paper as he hath done; ſo much cauſe have the beſt among us to pray to God to take away the iniquity of our holy things, and to praydaily, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes,</hi> known and unknown.</p>
               <p>I ſhall adde no more but this, That having read <hi>Mr. Kendals</hi> booke, as I cannot but ſay, that in dealing with <hi>Mr. John, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win, Miſcuit, utile, dulci;</hi> ſo I cannot ſay, that in dealing with <hi>Mr. Baxter, Omne tulit punctum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Craving excuſe for this digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I ſhall now returne. As for a tranſient action, it is commonly ſaid to be ſuch as doth <hi>tranſire in ſubjectum externum, ſeu extraneam materiem,</hi> or is terminated in ſome ſubject from without. But withal wee muſt know, that this is a deſcription of a tranſient acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not in general, or in its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral nature, but of tranſient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170180:118"/>of one ſort or kind, there being another kind of tranſient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and ſo ſtiled, becauſe they do <hi>referre ad terminum, ſeu eum producere, qui ſit extra cauſam a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentem;</hi> in which reſpect creation is juſtly accounted a tranſient acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for although it doth not <hi>tranſire in praejacentem materiem (quia actio creantis antevertit omne ſubjectum, quia illa eſt ex nihilo)</hi> yet is it ſuch an action of God, by which God produceth ſomething, not in, but without himſelf. Thus have I ſet downe what an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and what a tranſient action is, and the difference betwixt them out of the aforeſaid Author [the one being terminated within the ſubject, and working no reall change out of it, as doth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:] unto which, though nothing more ſeemes needful to be added, [the ſaid Author being among metaphyſical Writers in my ſlender judgment <hi>verè</hi>

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170180:120"/>in the ſequel of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitation;) do work in or upon the ſinner a real change: and as to the reality therefore of a change there ſeems to me to bee no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at all; and yet there being ſundry kinds of real changes, or all real changes being not of the ſame kind, this to my ſeeming is the difference betwixt them; <hi>viz.</hi> That Gods ſanctifying a ſinner, doth work a real change in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, from Corruption to Grace, from the evil of ſin, to the good of holineſſe; which for that cauſe may not unfitly be ſtiled a real, moral, or holy change; and Gods juſtifying or pardoning a ſinner, doth work in him, or upon him, a real change from the evil of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery or puniſhment, to the good of happineſſe; and which for that reaſon, <hi>&amp; docendi gratiâ,</hi> I may ſtile a real, phyſical, or political, or happy change: but why this change ſhould be ſtiled purely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, and be denied to be real, in way of contradiction to that of Sanctification, I for my part am
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170180:121"/>not as yet convinced, this change being ſuch in reality and in very deed, as is wrought in or upon a poor naked and wounded man, when of poor he is made rich, and of wounded is made whole. Thus really, as to mee ſeemeth, doth Gods juſtifying or pardoning a ſinner, alter or change the ſinner from what he was afore, as well in perſon as in relation; the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this change as really diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from thoſe who are not juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pardoned, as doth a child of wrath and mercy, or as doth a Saint in glory from a Reprobate in hell. Solid and judicious Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> in his <hi>Vindiciae Foeàeris,</hi> in his undertaking to prove Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be not an Immanent, but a tranſient act in God, doth ſeem to vary from what hath been commonly taught by our Divines, in acknowledging that the Effect which Juſtification doth work, as terminated in a ſinner, is a<note n="*" place="margin">The like alſo doth Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in his Book of <hi>Juſtif. p.</hi> 169.</note> real Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: for otherwiſe I ſee no cauſe why he ſhould parallel Gods grace in juſtifying a ſinner, to the grace
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170180:121"/>or favour which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe towards <hi>Joſeph</hi> in bringing him out of Priſon, ſaying, <hi>That act of</hi> Pharaoh <hi>had as real an effect upon</hi> Joſeph, <hi>and was terminated in him in his advancement out of Priſon, for rule in</hi> Egypt, <hi>as though a Phyſician in caſe of ſickneſſe had wrought a cure upon him.</hi> For my own part, I cannot but think, that look what real change is wrought in a poor priſoner by his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of priſon, or in a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man by his cure, ſuch a real change is wrought in or upon a ſinner by Gods juſtifying and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning him; Gods remitting ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners being reſembled to, or being ſet forth by <hi>healing the broken hearted, delivering Captives, and ſetting at liberty them that are brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding the ſaid compariſon to illuſtrate that change which Juſtification doth work in a ſinner, Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> (and in that particular I am not ſatisfied) doth expreſly deny, That Juſtification doth work any phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical change in man; and in that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170180:122"/>ſaying I cannot but profeſſe my diſſent from him. The reaſon why our Divines have commonly denyed, that Juſtification or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin doth work any real change, or any change upon the ſinner more then relative, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive to be this; <hi>viz.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do generally look upon remiſſion of ſin to be onely a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obligation of the ſinner from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; <hi>i. e.</hi> from being bound to ſuffer that puniſhment, which otherwiſe would have been ſooner or later inflicted: but ſeeing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin is as wel Gods taking away of puniſhment already infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon the ſinner, as Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the ſinner from being obliged to ſuffer that puniſhment, which otherwiſe according to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, hee would have inflicted at one time or other; as in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the change is relative, ſo in that reſpect it is unqueſtionably real.</p>

               <p>But my Apology is, 1. As I do much magnifie the ſaid Authours, (Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily accounted among the moſt pious and learned Divines that our Engliſh Nation hath brought forth) ſo I ſhould abhor my ſelfe as in duſt and aſhes, ſhould my conſcience in the leaſt accuſe me of any willingneſſe to detract from them, or of ſeeking to magnifie
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170180:124"/>my ſelf in oppoſing them; unto whoſe inferiours by very many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees I muſt ever confeſſe my ſelfe inferior not a little.</p>
               <p n="2">2 An endeavour (as in the fear of God with modeſty and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) to diſcover errour in whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and to vindicate the truth (ſpecially ſuch Truthes and Errors which are of momentous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) will be (I doubt not) acceptable to God, however it ſhould prove ungrateful to ſome men.</p>

               <p n="4">4. I am verily perſwaded, that were the foreſaid Authors (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170180:124"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> accounting it their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſee that as an errour, which they look'd upon as a truth, and a kindneſſe from any one, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God ſhould prove the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch a diſcovery.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If I my ſelf, when firſt a Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in controverſal divinity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſſe able to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt things that differ, have been ready to ſwallow all things as true which I have read in the foreſaid Authours; is it not my duty being now converted, to ſtrengthen my brethren?</p>
               <p>Now for the purpoſe in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> for diſcovery, that Gods <hi>Negatio volitionis puniendi,</hi> is no part of the pardon of ſin, be it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the pardon of ſin, both the whole and every part thereof, is [<hi>in toto</hi> and in <hi>ſolido,</hi> as wee uſe to ſay] to be aſcribed to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, blood-ſhed, or ſatisfaction of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the meritorious and pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170180:125"/>But Gods <hi>Negatio volitionis puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endi</hi> is not to be aſcribed to Chriſts blood ſhed or ſatisfaction as the procuring or meritorious cauſe thereof. For Gods <hi>Negatio volitionis puniendi</hi> is all one with his <hi>velle non punire,</hi> as the Doctor doth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately expreſſe himſelfe afterwards; and Gods <hi>velle non punire</hi> is all one with his <hi>velle miſereri,</hi> which ſaid <hi>velle non punire,</hi> or <hi>velle miſereri,</hi> are precedent, and not conſequent to the conſideratation of Chriſts blood-ſhed and Satisfaction: For Chriſt by his ſatisfaction or blood ſhed, did procure and purchaſe for ſinners (as our Divines in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to thoſe Arguments which the <hi>Socinians</hi> doe object againſt Chriſts ſatisfaction uſually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) not Gods <hi>miſereri velle,</hi> but his <hi>miſereri poſſe.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">In ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo I do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude but include the particular fruits of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by the blood of Chriſt.</note> Briefly, Gods <hi>velle non punire,</hi> is all one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly in ſenſe and ſubſtance with his election, or electing love; which albeit it is in Chriſt, yet it is not for Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> not for Chriſt as the procurer or purchaſer therof, as the Doctor himſelfe in a large diſpute
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170180:125"/>doth prove, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 151. there being ſcarce any one of our refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Divines, except <hi>Rolloc,</hi> who ſayes the contrary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Gods will not to puniſh, is all one as his purpoſe not to puniſh. Now, albeit this will or purpoſe (being all one with election) is the riſe or fountain of pardon, yet is it not pardon it ſelf, or any part or parcel of it, but differs as much from it, as a gift doth from the free love and good will of him, who did beſtow it, or did deſigne the beſtowing of it. Briefly, Gods willing not to puniſh, is nothing elſe but Gods purpoſe to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Now Gods purpoſe to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is one thing, and pardon it ſelfe is another, as hath beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Gods not willing to puniſh is (as the Doctor himſelfe doth rightly acknowledge in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing columne) an immanent act in God, and from eternitity, and no conſequent of faith (hee might have added likewiſe, no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of Chriſts merits and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170180:126"/>as was aforeſaid.) But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin is not an immanent act in God, nor from eternity (as was before proved) [for albeit God doth from eternity will the remiſſion of our ſins, yet he doth not will the remiſſion of our ſins from eternity;] and it is moreover (as ſhal hereafter in due place be proved) a conſequent of our faith: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Gods not willing to puniſh ſin, is no part of (however a thing neceſſarily preſuppoſed unto) the pardon of ſin, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="2">2.

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170180:127"/>which as it doth follow (for ought I know) from the Doctors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, ſo alſo from the Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians Principles, which ſome of them being ſenſible of, have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen rather then to leave their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, to ſwallow down the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and abſurdity thereof, and to aſſert, That Chriſt did not purchaſe or procure any love from God for man: but onely publiſhed and declared, That he was from eternity beloved and pardoned.

               <p n="3">3 The Doctor holds, That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin, and the acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our perſons with God, do only note certain internal and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Actions in God, which never had any beginning with

               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:170180:131"/>
               <p>I think this inference the rather to be obſerved, not only becauſe it is practical, and of frequent uſe, but alſo becauſe of that new mode or model of praying taken up by too too many in theſe times, infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with Antinomian leaven, who do ſo neglect the confeſſion of their ſins, and the guilt thereof, together with ſupplication to the Lord for the pardon of them, as if theſe were no parts of prayer for a believer, or as if they were anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated, and like an old Almanack,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170180:131"/>uſeleſſe and out of date. Or if they do make the ſaid confeſſions and ſupplications, they do but juggle and diſſemble, ſaying, (if they be reaſoned with) That pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with others, or as the voice of others, it is the ſin and guilt of the wicked and unbelievers which they confeſſe, and of which they pray for pardon; but not of their own and of the godly, of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don whereof they are already aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured; faith it ſelf being in their ſenſe, and according to their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryphal Goſpel, nothing elſe but a firm beliefe or perſwaſion, that all their ſins paſt, preſent, and to come, were remitted at once, and that from eternity. The not underſtanding the true nature of forgiveneſſe of ſin, as well where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it doth not conſiſt, as wherein it doth conſiſt (as hath been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened and aſſerted in the Premiſes) is a main reaſon (as I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) of the pride and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that ſort of people, both in this particular and ſundry other wayes.</p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:170180:132"/>
               <p>What I have ſaid as the ground of this Inference, I would have the Reader to know, That it doth fully agree with what Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> ſaith in his book of Juſtification, <hi>p.</hi> 29. <hi>Now when ſin is forgiven, the ſenſe is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not that hee is made innocent again, for that can never be helped; but that it muſt be affirmed, ſuch a one hath ſinned; this cannot be repaired again.</hi> And therefore if any Reader is not able to reconcile what Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> hath there ſaid, with what hee ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 142. <hi>When God doth pardon ſin, he takes it away ſo, as that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty acquitted is no more looked upon as a ſinner;</hi> All the expreſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout pardon amount to thus much, Even as when one accuſed of theft and murder in the Commonwealth, and is legally acquitted by the Judg, he is no more reputed a Thief or Murderer: Therefore it is a calumny of the Papiſts, as if we held, That a man is a ſinner after God hath pardoned him. If any one, I ſay, cannot reconcile theſe ſayings with the former, I
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170180:132"/>would adviſe him (if I might be ſo bold with my betters, to obſerve well what he ſaith in the former place, and to let that paſſe what he ſaith in the latter paſſage. For my owne part, as I muſt profeſſe my inſufficiency to reconcile Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> to himſelfe in the ſaid paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and withal my ignorance, that I know no ſuch calumny of the Papiſts againſt us; ſo (had I known it) I would not have ſought by an anſwer to have wiped it off; for I am perſwaded with Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> in <hi>p.</hi> 19. <hi>That a man after God hath pardoned him, is not made inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent again;</hi> and if he be not inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent again, he is (to my thinking) a ſinner ſtill, and as we are, ſo doth God look upon us, for his uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring eye ſees all things as they are, and not otherwiſe; and as for all the expreſſions of Scripture about the pardon of ſin, they do (being rightly underſtood and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) amount to this; <hi>viz.</hi> That albeit a ſinner being pardoned, is not thereby made innocent, but is ſtill guilty, and a ſinner; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170180:133"/>God doth look upon ſuch a one as a ſinner, and as guilty; <hi>viz</hi> in the ſenſe aforeſaid, nevertheleſs God of his ſuperabounding grace and mercy, in and for Chriſts ſake, doth not deal with ſuch a one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ſin and guilt, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. To this ſenſe, and no more, do I take that of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> to amount, which is one of the higheſt expreſſions touching the pardon of ſin that we read of in the Scripture, <hi>chap.</hi> 50.20. <hi>In thoſe dayes and at that time, ſaith the Lord, The iniquity of Iſrael ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none; and the ſins of Judah, and they ſhall not be found; for I will pardon them.</hi> This expreſſion, I ſay, is Tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount (as I think) but this, That God will in his great mercy ſo deal with his Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if ſhe had been innocent, or as if ſhe had not tranſgreſſed.</p>
               <p>The whole of this inference is grounded on what was aforeſaid concerning the nature of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſin, wherein it doth not conſiſt; <hi>viz.</hi> Not in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170180:133"/>a ſinner to be no ſinner, or a a guilty perſon not guilty, as in the ſenſe aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>The next Inference will bee grounded upon what was ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the obligation of a ſinner to hell and damnation, being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off not abſolutely in this life, but conditionally; <hi>viz.</hi> upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their perſeverance in the faith.</p>
               <p>But in the cloſe of this Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctary, let me informe the Reader, how that ſince I wrote this Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation, I have read Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> learned Book, <hi>De Reconciliatione,</hi> as alſo Mr. <hi>Pembles</hi> book of <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> in both which I find the truth of that which Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> doth ſay, and of which I was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant before; <hi>viz</hi> That the Papiſts do charge us for aſſerting, That a ſinner after pardon doth remain a ſinner. And I find, that Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> doth endeavour to wipe off that imputation, by ſaying <hi>That ſin is pardoned both in the guilt and in the fault:</hi> In which anſwer of his I am very much diſſatisfied,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170180:134"/>having afore proved, That the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the fault, is the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the very puniſhment; or that the remiſſion of the pun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is wholly and ſolely that wherein the remiſſion of the fault doth conſiſt; the remiſſion of the fault and puniſhment not being two things diſtinct, but exactly one and the ſame: ſo that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever wee read in Gods Word concerning the remiſſion of our faults, or ſins, we are to underſtand thereby, the remiſsion of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to our ſaid faults or ſins.</p>
               <p>The phraſe, <hi>[To be looked upon as a ſinner,]</hi> is indeed an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous phraſe, implying (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the uſual diſtinction of Gods ſight, or ſight in God it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken either <hi>in ſenſu ſimplici,</hi> or <hi>in ſenſu connotativo</hi>) either Gods bare or meer intuitive ſight, and beholding us as ſinners; or elſe his dealing with us as ſinners: in which latter ſenſe it is moſt true, That God doth not look upon a ſinner pardoned as a ſinner (for
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170180:134"/>then he ſhould look upon him as not pardoned; ſince Gods pardon is his not dealing with a ſinner as a ſinner; <hi>i. e.</hi> according to his deſert by ſin;) and for this reaſon I do allow, and not quarrel with the foreſaid expreſsion, it being alſo an expreſſion very neer to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but in the former reſpect God doth look upon him as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for otherwiſe he ſhould not look upon him as pardoned, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſible, <hi>ex naturâ rei</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for God or man in this ſenſe to look upon any perſon as pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and not as a ſinner; for ſtill where there is pardon there muſt be<note n="*" place="margin">Sin is the <hi>res ſubſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta</hi> to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</note> ſin, elſe a perſon were not in a capacity of pardon.</p>
               <p>Now as I am not ſatisfied with Mr. <hi>Pembles,</hi> ſo neither with Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> his anſwer to the foreſaid imputation of the Papiſts, the one ſaying, <hi>That both the fault or guilt is taken away by pardon;</hi> and the other granting, that wee hold, <hi>That a ſinner is not a ſinner after God hath pardoned him;</hi> which I for my part cannot ſee reaſon to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170180:135"/>grant, becauſe (as hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proved) the effect of pardon is not to make a ſinner no ſinner, but not to deal with him as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or in the phraſe of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.10. <hi>Not to deal with him after his ſins, or to reward him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his iniquities.</hi> I doubt that ſome will ſharply cenſure, and almoſt be imbittered againſt me for thus ſcanning the words of ſuch moſt learned and godly men, (with whom, 'tis true, I am not worthy to be named the ſame day) and will prophecy concerning me, That I ſhall be ſure to have the ſame meaſure from others, in having all my words and ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſcann'd to purpoſe; but my own heart witneſſing to me, That I do bleſſe and magnifie the name of God for thoſe men and their excellent Labours, from whom in ſome things I do expreſſe my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and that I do endeavour, <hi>expiſcari veritatem,</hi> to find out the truth with all due reſpect, and in another ſenſe, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to perſons; I am hopeful,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170180:135"/>that the moſt of my reverend and learned brethren in the Miniſtry will not hold me guilty, eſpecially when I ſhall profeſſe before the world (even as I now do by theſe preſents;) <hi>viz.</hi> That if there bee any man who ſhall evidence that to be currant and juſtifiable, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I do declare my diſſent or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction, I ſhall not in any meaſure (by the grace of God) be offended at the diſcovery of Truth, though thereby, and therewithal my owne weakneſſe of judgement bee diſcovered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</p>

               <p>Albeit this inference bee very cleer from the Premiſes, and of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable neceſsity, nevertheleſſe I ſhall be very punctual and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, as well in the proving of it by other Scriptures, as in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170180:137"/>ſuch Objections as may, or are uſually made againſt it by the Antinomians; and this I ſhall the rather do for the following Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is a Truth under much prejudice, and againſt which many miſ-informed people, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Antinomians, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch indignation of heart, as that upon the hearing thereof from the mouth of any Miniſter, they are ready almoſt to rend their cloathes, as the Jewes were wont to do upon the hearing of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, crying out againſt us, and ſaying, Away with ſuch legal Preachers from the Church, it is not fit that they ſhould live upon the maintenance, or bear the name of Goſpel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a truth of concernment, the greater, by how much the contrary Doctrine is of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenc. (as I think) exceeding dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: for I cannot eaſily think any opinion more dangerous for a Chriſtian to entertain then
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170180:137"/>this; <hi>viz.</hi> That he is to live alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without the fear of hell, as being in no poſſible danger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. I read of ſome in theſe times (particularly of one <hi>Coppin,</hi> who preaching frequently in theſe parts, as in ſeveral other Countyes in the Land, hath gathered of the profane ſort of people ſundry Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples after him) who do hold, that there is<note n="*" place="margin">This appears by ſeveral Pamphlets in print under the name of <hi>Rich. Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin.</hi>
                  </note> no Reſurrection, no day of Judgment, no Salvation, no Damnation, no Heaven, nor Hel, but what is in this life. Next to the belief of this, [That there is no hell after death,] I hold this opinion or belief to be moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; <hi>viz.</hi> That a Chriſtian, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he is once a true Believer, is in no danger at all of hell, and is not therefore in any ſort to entertaine the fear of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As the danger is very great, ſo it is very common; for we ſee in experience, how ordinary it is with the Antinomians to caſt off all fear, and that which ſhould cauſe fear; <hi>viz.</hi> the threatnings of God in Scripture, as not at all,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170180:138"/>or in any ſenſe concerning them. As it is the profeſſion of ſome in theſe times to live above all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and all Scripture, even e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of Gods Word, ſo it is the profeſſion of the Antinomians, though not to live above all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and all Scriptures, yet to live above all the thereatnings of Scripture, and above all the curſes and comminations of the Word of God, in ſo much that as God laid it to the charge of his <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, that he had written unto them the <hi>great things of his Law, but they accounted them as a ſtrange thing,</hi> Hoſ. 8.12. So may it bee ſaid of the Antinomians, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the comminations of the Word, God hath written unto them the grand threatnings of his Law, and they look upon them as ſtrange things; as things ſtrange to them, becauſe in no ſort (as they think) concerning them, or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as intended for them, but only for the wicked, who are actually under the curſe. This their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is ſo much the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170180:138"/>becauſe as to live above one part [the threatnings] of the Word is, a ready way to live above another part [the Precepts] of the Word; ſo many of thoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereby they plead to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their practice in caſting off the threatnings of Scripture as uſeleſſe to them, will by their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect conſequence lead them to caſt off both Precepts and Promiſes as uſeleſs alſo.</p>

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170180:139"/>God is to bee believed in all his ſayings, of what nature ſoever they be, or whatever the contents there of are, the truth of God being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in all his ſayings. It is no leſs the duty of the godly to believe God in what he threatens to them, then of the wicked to believe God in what he threatens to them; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pattern of the men of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, <hi>That in what was threatned by Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah they believed God.</hi> Jonah 3.5.

               <p>Briefly, As the Iſraelites were to hear the curſes of the Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon Mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> as wel as the bleſſings thereof pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> and were to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to the former as well as to the latter, ſo the godly are to affix their <hi>Amen,</hi> or to put their Seal of Faith unto the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings as well as to the Promiſes of the Word, whenſoever they read or hear them; yea, they are as

God muſt quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en

               <p>Now this being the meaning of that phraſe, I anſwer, That by the ſame reaſon that a beliver is ſaid to do the good hee doth out of a principle of life and love, he may be ſaid to do it out of a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of life and fear: for</p>

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:170180:158"/>that the difference betwixt theſe two ſorts of fears, is much miſtaken by very many: for, whereas it is commonly thought and taught, that filial and ſervile fear do differ in their material ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or have different objects; the object of filial fear being God in the notion of a loving Father, or God and his goodneſſe and no otherwiſe: and the object of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile fear being (as they ſay) God as a Judge, or God and his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</item>

               <p>I muſt crave leave in this place, to give in my opinion to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and to aſſert, That theſe two fears do differ, not in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter, or thing feared, but in the manner of fearing; for the material object even of godly and filial fear, is God <hi>[a conſuming fire,]</hi> or the eternal vengeance of God, as well as of ſervile fear; as is to me paſt all doubt or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction moſt evident by thoſe two Scriptures before cited, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28, 29. and <hi>Luke</hi> 12.4, 5. A god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, or a child of God, as wel as
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:170180:158"/>a wicked man, or an enemy of God, is to fear hel and damnation, as was before plainly and plentifully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and therefore hell and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation muſt needs be the object, as well of filial as of ſervile fear. One main difference betwixt theſe two fears, I do therefore conceive to be in the manner how thoſe dreadful objects are feared, they being in a different manner feared by a ſon and by a ſlave, by a godly, and by a wicked man.</p>
               <p>The Anſwer then which I will give to that place of Scripture, ſhall be by diſtinguiſhing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a twofold fear, I mean two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold in reſpect of the manner of fearing, as followeth. A man may fear hell and damnation two wayes:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. As that which he is actually for preſent obliged to ſuffer, or as that which he knowes will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide him <hi>[rebus ſic ſtantibus,]</hi> in his preſent ſtate and condition, or in thoſe wayes wherein hitherunto he hath walked, and ſtill doth walk in.</item>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:170180:159"/>
                  <item>2 A man may fear hell and damnation, as that from the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, albeit for the preſent he be diſcharged, as being in the ſtate of grace, which nevertheleſſe he may and ſhall ſuffer, if he abide not in his preſent ſtate of Grace, or continue not in that way of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe wherein he is going. The former kind of fear I may not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly ſtile a poſitive fear, and the latter ſuppoſitive; the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſolutely exerciſed, or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the other conditionally. The former indeed is that kind of fear which we commonly call <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi> and it is the fruit or effect of the ſpirit of bondage ſpoken of by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> as that which the ſons of God are delivered from, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 2 14, 15. None but the ſlaves of Satan and the Divels bondmen are in ſuch ſort to fear hell and damnation. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then of that in <hi>Luke</hi> 1.79. is, That Chriſt hath delivered us from this poſitive fear of evil, or the fearing of evil in this poſitive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it being the ſcope of <hi>Zachary</hi>

               <p n="2">2 By how much it is more ſweet by ſo much it is like with the more eagerneſſe to be ſwallowed. The

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVIII.</hi> That the repentance, which the Goſpel requires, is not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance <hi>[from]</hi> the pardon of our ſins, as the Antinomians affirm, but <hi>[for]</hi> the pardon of them, proved and evinced by ſeveral Arguments. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Objections of the Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians anſwered; wherein it is punctually declared, In what ſenſe Evangelical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance may be ſaid to be <hi>[from]</hi> pardon of ſin, and in what ſenſe <hi>[for]</hi> the pardon of it. It is diſputable whether Gods glory and our own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are to be looked at as two
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170180:167"/>ends, or only as one, the former being a neceſſary reſult of the latter. An Objection anſwered, That it is a ſingular favour of God, and a favour in ſome ſenſe peculiar to the times of the New Teſtament, that God hath ſo cleerly revealed unto us our eternal ſalvation, as the great end, not excluding, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding his glory) of mans working, or of all Chriſtian duty. That good works may be ſtiled the way to ſalvation. That the difference betwixt the Covenant of Work and of Grace lyes not in this, that <hi>Adam</hi> was to work <hi>for</hi> life, and we not <hi>for,</hi> but only <hi>from</hi> life. Our own good works, duties graces or holineſſe, how far forth, or in what ſenſe to be diſclaimed, and not truſted unto for ſalvation, as alſo in what ſenſe, or how farre
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170180:167"/>forth they may be truſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or reſted in for ſalvation, declared more at large. A Caution annexed to prevent miſtake. That there are two kinds of preſumption, both which are diſtinctly to be made knowne unto people by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be avoided by all, as dangerous rocks in the ſteering of our courſe towards the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of eternal happineſſe.</head>
               <head>CONSECT. XXII</head>
               <p n="22">22. IT followes, That the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel requireth is not only repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <hi>[from]</hi> the pardon of our ſins, but <hi>[for]</hi> the pardon of them. Pardon of ſin being the taking away from the ſinner ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to puniſhment, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment it ſelf, and theſe being not taken away till a ſinner hath
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170180:168"/>repented of his ſins (as is evident by the Scriptures, otherwiſe an impenitent perſon had as much right to heaven, and were as much in the ſtate of ſalvation as the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent;) it doth unavoidably from thence follow, That that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which the Goſpel requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth as ſaving repentance, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance neceſſary to ſalvation, (I mean, our firſt repentance, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance at our firſt converſion) is <hi>for,</hi> and not <hi>from</hi> the pardon of our ſins.</p>
               <p>I am willing to take occaſion to ſpeak ſomewhat more at large for the confirmation and cleering of this inference, and for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the contrary, becauſe it is one branch of the Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian Doctrine in theſe times, That all repentance which is not <hi>from</hi> the pardon of ſin; <hi>i. e.</hi> the ſenſe and belief of pardon, is but Legal and not Evangelical repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and that to teach people to repent <hi>for</hi> the pardon of their ſins, is to diſhonour and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne Chriſt, to make a Chriſt of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170180:168"/>our repentance. Now for the confutation of this new Anti-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Doctrine, and for a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans confirmation in the good and old Doctrine of Chriſt, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to demonſtrate, touching the ſaid Doctrine of the Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, theſe two things,
<list>
                     <item>1. That it is directly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly againſt the truth of the Goſpel.</item>
                     <item>2. Againſt the comfort of the Goſpel.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>For the demonſtration of the former, let the following particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We do very ſeldome, I think, never at all read in the Word of God, that any of Gods Prophets, Chriſt Jeſus or his Apoſtles, did preſſe any perſon or people to repent from the pardon of their ſins. Its true indeed, that ſinners are frequently exhorted to repent, from the conſideration of Gods mercy and goodneſſe, in his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to pardon them; <hi>i.e.</hi> to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them in ſuch wayes, or upon
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:170180:169"/>ſuch termes, as in and upon which God is purpoſed to diſpenſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; <hi>i.e.</hi> to pardon them if they do repent, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12, 13, 14. but where ſhall we read in all the Book of God, that ſinners are urged and exhorted to repent from the belief, ſenſe, or conſideration of Gods grace and goodneſſe in this, That he hath already pardoned thoſe ſins, for which they are called upon to repent?</p>
               <p n="2">2 Suppoſe that ſome inſtance could be produced out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſome ſinner or ſinners, that have been informed from God, and told before hand, that their ſins were pardoned, and were thereupon exhorted to repent: I would anſwer, That ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or inſtances will not prove, that it is a Chriſtians duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent <hi>from</hi> and not <hi>for</hi> the pardon of his ſins: for it is the manner of of the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture ſometimes to pronounce or make promiſe of the end, and then to direct and exhort unto the uſe of meanes <hi>for</hi> the accompliſhing of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:170180:169"/>that end, and without the uſe whereof it ſhall not be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; <hi>e. g.</hi> God doth firſt tell <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that he ſhal recover of his diſeaſe, and that he would add to his life fifteen years, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon God directs him what means to uſe for his recovery; <hi>viz.</hi> A bunch of figs applyed to his byle. Becauſe God had told <hi>Hezekiah</hi> before hand that he would adde fifteen years to his life, ſhall wee therefore conclude, That <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> did apply the bunch of figs, and did ever after that time eat and drink <hi>from</hi> life, and not <hi>for</hi> life?</p>
               <p n="3">3. To ſay, That a ſinner muſt repent <hi>from</hi> the pardon of his ſins, and not <hi>for</hi> the pardon of them, if he will repent Evangelically, is to make a ſinners pardon to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his repentance; whereas the Scripture informes us, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin doth follow repentance, and not go before it, as reward fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes the Service, or as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of a promiſed reward doth follow the performance of the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:170180:170"/>condition of the Promiſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2 38. <hi>Repent and be baptized for the remiſſion of your ſins.</hi> Acts 5.31. <hi>Him hath God exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance to Iſrael and remiſſion of ſin.</hi> Iſai. 55 7, 8. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him returne unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and unto our God, for he will,</hi> (not hee hath) <hi>abundantly pardon.</hi> 2 Chron. 7.13, 14. <hi>If my people that are called by my name ſhall humble themſelves and pray, and ſeek my face, and turne from their evil wayes, then will I hear from heaven my dwelling place, and will forgive their ſins.</hi> Where do we read, that Chriſt his Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did ever preach to any ſinner or ſinners that their ſins were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pardoned, till they had actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally repented? Yea, what war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant hath a Miniſter of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſo much as to propound or promiſe unto any perſon or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Pardon of their ſins, but upon precedent repentance for
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:170180:170"/>ſin? See <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. and 24.47. Well I wot, That the Miniſters of the Goſpel are to publiſh to all the world, That the Meſſias is come in the fleſh, hath ſatisfied Gods Juſtice, made an attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or propitiation for the ſins of the whole world; <hi>i. e.</hi> that Chriſt Jeſus hath done whatſoever did belong for him to do on earth (as a Surety) to the ſatisfying of Gods Juſtice, the pardon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation of ſinners: But I wot withal, That albeit the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Gods Juſtice and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of pardon doth wholely and ſolely depend upon the doings and ſufferings of Chriſts as the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe thereof; ſo our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a part or benefit in the ſaid purchaſe and ſatisfaction doth depend upon the doing or perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of all ſuch Goſpel Duties which Chriſt hath appointed or commanded, as the condition without which we are to have no ſaving comfort and benefit by him; the performance of which ſaid du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is nevertheleſſe through the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:170180:171"/>help of Gods free grace purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Chriſt, and a fruit of his Redemption.</p>
               <p n="4">4 As wee have no precept in Gods Word, bidding us to repent <hi>from</hi> the pardon of ſin, ſo we have frequent precepts commanding us to repent <hi>for</hi> pardon, or that we may be pardoned, or leſt wee ſhould miſſe of pardon. See <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Repent,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>into the remiſſion of your ſins.</hi> Acts 3.19. <hi>Repent</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>into the bloting out of your ſins.</hi> Amos 5.14. <hi>Seek good and not evil, that ye may live.</hi> So that to preach, that That repentance which is for, and not purely from the pardon of our ſins, is not evangelical repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is directly and clearly to pervert the Goſpel of Chriſt in its Doctrine of repentance.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is far more agreeable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Scripture and to right reaſon to ſay, That we are to <hi>rejoyce</hi> from the pardon of our ſins, then to ſay We are to <hi>repent</hi> from the pardon of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is more agreeable to
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:170180:171"/>Scripture to ſay the former then the latter, may appear (beſides by what hath been already ſaid) by that in <hi>Match</hi> 9.2. <hi>Son, be of good cheer, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2 It is more agreeable to reaſon: for the pardon of ſin is the object of Joy, not of ſorrow. As ſin it ſelf is the proper object matter, or material object of ſorrow, ſo the pardon of it is the material ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of joy; thence that of the Angel to the Shepherds, <hi>Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people: for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you is born this day a Saviour,</hi> Luke 2.10, 11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yea thirdly, agreeable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is the experience of the Saints: for as ſome do weep for ſorrow, that their ſins may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; ſo others do weep for joy that to their owne ſenſe they are pardoned; neither ought this
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:170180:172"/>to ſeeme ſtrange, there<note n="*" place="margin">Such it ſeemes were the tears of her in <hi>Luke</hi> 7.38. Chriſt ſaying of her, not ſhe grieved much, (though that doubt-leſſe was true) but <hi>ſhe loved much.</hi>
                  </note> being tears of love and rejoycing, as well as of mourning.</p>
               <p>Theſe things conſidered, let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one judge whether thoſe who tell people, That to repent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelically is to repent <hi>from,</hi> not <hi>for</hi> the pardon of ſin, do not tell them in effect, That to weep for ſin in a Goſpel way, is to weep for joy, but not for grief? and conſequently whether they do not overturn Goſpel Repentance, <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum vorſum,</hi> topſie-turvy (as we uſe to ſay?) For whereas the Goſpel of Chriſt tells us, that evangelical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to ſorrow after a godly manner,</hi> or <hi>a ſorrow after God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9, 10. Conſider and judg whether theſe new Goſpel Preachers do not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make it a joy after God, or a rejoycing after a godly manner, or godly joy, rather then godly ſorrow</p>
               <p n="5">5 Were Evangelical repentance only <hi>from,</hi> and not <hi>for</hi> the pardon of ſin, then ſhould our Saviour Chriſt in rendring the reaſon of the bleſſedneſſe of ſuch mourners;<note place="margin">Mat. 5.4.</note>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:170180:172"/>have ſaid, not as he did, <hi>For they ſhall Be comforted,</hi> but <hi>For they Are comforted;</hi> there being no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er comfort then the ſenſe or aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of pardon.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Let it (for a further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the ſaid Doctrine) be conſidered, what are thoſe grounds Ends, Reaſons, or Motives, for, or upon which ſinners are invited, or exhorted in Scripture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. <hi>E.g.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Becauſe we have offended and diſhonoured God by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing his command. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I finned,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Becauſe God is very gracious and merciful, ready to pardon all thoſe who do repent, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12, 13,

               <p>Theſe and the like Arguments, or Grounds of Repentance, wee do frequently read of in the Word of God; which I do alledg, not to prove, that the ſenſe of the free mercy of God in pardoning a Believers former ſins ſhould not induce him the more to repent of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:170180:173"/>his preſent ſins (for in that ſenſe I do acknowledg, that a Believer is to repent, and doth repent <hi>from</hi> the pardon of ſin; yet ſo <hi>from</hi> the pardon of former ſins, or ſins long ſince pardoned, as ſtill <hi>for</hi> the pardon of his other ſins:) but the aforeſaid Reaſons are alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me to prove, That a ſinner is to repent <hi>for</hi> the pardon of his ſins, and that repentance <hi>for</hi> pardon is true, genuine, Scripture-Goſpel-Repentance; <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as Chriſt, his Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles do enjoyne both for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and circumſtance, as a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As the ſaid Doctrine is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Truth, ſo is it alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Comfort of the Goſpel; and let it bee conſidered what a moſt uncomfortable Doctrine it is to tell ſinners, that Goſpel-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is <hi>from</hi> and not <hi>for</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; for, will it not follow from thence, That no ſinner did ever truly, ſavingly, and Evangelically repent, but ſuch only who have the ſenſe or aſſurance of pardon
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:170180:174"/>in their owne ſouls? then which Doctrine we cannot lightly preach any more diſmal, dark, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable. Is the preaching of this Doctrine the way to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thoſe who mourne in <hi>Sion,</hi> and the preaching of glad tydings to the meek? Is this to pour oyl and wine, or is it not rather to pour gall and vinegar into woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded conſciences? And is it not ſtrange then, that thoſe who do preach ſuch anti-Goſpel Doctrine, ſo oppoſite both to the Truth and comfort of the Goſpel, ſhould pretend to ſuch zeal for Chriſt and his Goſpel, and to ſuch art in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting a Chriſtian? May not we truly ſay concerning theſe mens zeal of the Goſpel, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of his Country men their zeal of the Law; <hi>viz.</hi> That it is not according to knowledg?</p>
               <p>The main ground of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians Errour in ſaying, That Goſpel repentance is <hi>from,</hi> and not <hi>for</hi> pardon, is (as I conceive) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hold, That ſin is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pardoned before it be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:170180:174"/>of; and obſerving therefore how one error (like the links of a chain) doth draw on another, we ſhould be the more watchful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every errour, and pray to the Father of lights to give us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in all things.</p>
               <p>I ſhall in the next place endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to anſwer the uſual Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are made by the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians againſt their adverſaries, who hold, That a Believer is to work not <hi>for</hi> pardon, <hi>for</hi> life, <hi>for</hi> redemption, and <hi>for</hi> ſalvation, but <hi>from</hi> them. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in ſeveral of his writings ſaid ſo much already about this Point, as that I ſhall not much need to ſay any thing more. For my own part, I am ſingularly glad that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath admoniſhed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to beware of the Book ſtiled, <hi>The Marrow of Modern Divinity,</hi> that doth harp ſo much upon that ſtring, not <hi>for,</hi> but <hi>from.</hi> The ſaid Book was about ſix or ſeven yeers ago commended unto me by a very honeſt and well meaning Chriſtian, which having ſought
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:170180:175"/>after, and throughly read, I could not but wonder (and not without ſome little but juſt, indignation) that three ſuch moſt excellent and famous Divines, as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> Mr <hi>B.</hi> and Mr. <hi>S.</hi> ſhould by their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Epiſtles commend ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terimyſtical and Caſſandrian piece as that Book may in its kind (I think) deſervedly be called; and I did thereupon make ſome Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions upon it long ſince, and in ſpecial concerning this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Point [<hi>From</hi> and not <hi>For;</hi>] For well I wot, that albeit we are to endeavour, as much as may be, the peace of Gods Churches (and I doubt not but goodneſſe and ſweetneſſe of nature and zeal for peace did ſo far prevail with thoſe three forementioned Worthies as to procure ſuch Teſtimonials from them) nevertheleſſe we are not to aſſert groſſe Errours (however we may, and its fit we ſhould ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, conceal ſome Truths) for peace ſake.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here therefore inſert what I have long ſince written, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>How abſurd and irrational then is it for any one to ſay, That a Chriſtian is not to repent <hi>for</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or to work <hi>for</hi> ſalvation? it is as if a man ſhould ſay, We muſt not uſe means for the end.</p>
               <p>Yea, why may I not ſay, That ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (I mean our own, and the ſalvation of others) is the maine and utmoſt end of a Chriſtians working, for as much as the glory of God doth therein conſiſt to the height or uttermoſt? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſeems vain for any one to except, ſaying, Gods glory is the utmoſt end: for the utmoſt of Gods glory <hi>[quoad hoc,]</hi> is in our ſalvation. Yea, ſo inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is Gods glory from our glory, as that God is not glorified to the uttermoſt by our glorifying him on earth, but by his glorifying us in heaven. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.10. <hi>When he ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe.</hi> When our bleſſed Saviour did pray to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaying, <hi>Father, glorifie thy Son, that thy Son alſo [may] glorifie

I ſay, truly and in a Scripture ſenſe, for in a true moral or Scripture ſenſe, he only can be ſaid to aim, (yea, to deſire) his own ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that takes the way, or doth the things which lead and tend to

Now ſince ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is that wherein Gods glory doth moſt eminently conſiſt, how is it poſſible to aim at the one, and not the other?

                  </note> We are commanded to make Gods glory the end of our ſalvation, I ſhall reply to ſuch a one, <hi>Profer tabulas,</hi> ſhew mee any Scripture where that command is written. For my owne part, till a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture record be produced for that purpoſe, I ſhall think ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be ſuperfluous: for if it be not ſaid, that Gods glory and our ſalvation are one and the ſelfe ſame thing, nevertheleſſe it muſt (I think) be ſaid, That Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doth iſſue and flow from our Salvation (will we, nill we) <hi>per modum reſultantiae,</hi> by reſult una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable.</p>
               <p>The end of my dilating thus upon this particular, is not peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily to conclude, That Gods glory and our ſalvation are to bee
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:170180:179"/>looked at as one end (for whether they ought to be looked at as one end, or as two ends in ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, this to that, it is not to my purpoſe, neither ſhall I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with any one who ſhall affirm either way) but to ſhew the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding weakneſs and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of the Antinomians, who under the pretence of exalting God and Chriſt in their glory, do forbid us to make our own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the end of our working. I have heard of ſome profeſſors of Religion, who are accounted knowing and gifted Chriſtians, at leaſt who are ſuch in their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, who though they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that a Chriſtian may eye his owne ſalvation, or have an eye to it or upon it, yet will ſtifly deny, that he may aim at it, or labor for it. But I would that ſuch wiſe ones would ſeriouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe that place of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.18. <hi>[While we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen.]</hi> and that withal they would peruſe the Original, or
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:170180:179"/>at leaſt ſuffer themſelvs to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med touching the word in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, which is tranſlated, <hi>While we look at,</hi> the Greek word being [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] which doth ſignifie, to look on a thing with ſuch an eye, as an Archer doth upon the white at which he aimes and ſhoots; ſo that the Apoſtle doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to ſay, that he did make the things not ſeen, <hi>viz.</hi> the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal weight of glory, ſpoken of in the verſe foregoing, (this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch indeed as <hi>eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9. 1 Joh. 3.2.) I ſay, The Apoſtle did not doubt to aver, that he with other faithful Chriſtians did make theſe things his ſcope and aime. And they who ſay, that we may eye Heaven, but not aim at it, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for it, do ſpeak as wiſely, as if they had ſaid, An Archer may eye the white, or have an eye upon it, but he is not to aim at it, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to hit it.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus hath purchaſed ſalvation and remiſſion for us, and why then ſhould we repent and work for them?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:170180:180"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This Objection hath in effect been anſwered already; <hi>viz.</hi> Whatſoever Chriſt hath purchaſed we are not to enjoy, but in Chriſts way and upon his termes, which is and are, that we give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the path of piety, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. Chriſt is not the Authour of Salvation unto any but ſuch as do obey him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is no outward bleſſing and comfort (be it meat, drink, and cloathing) but is purchaſed for the Elect by Chriſt, as well as is their ſalvation. If Chriſts pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe therefore is a ſufficient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, why we ſhould not work <hi>for</hi> ſalvation, and repent <hi>for</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, by a like reaſon we are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to work, yea, nor ſo much as to pray <hi>for</hi> daily bread. The truth is, the Antinomians have as good reaſon to forbid us to pray for daily bread, for health and ſtrength, for food and rayment, and to command us to pray <hi>from</hi> daily bread, from health &amp; ſtrength, from
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:170180:180"/>food and rayment, as they have to forbid us to repent and work for the remiſſion of our ſins, and for the ſalvation of our ſouls, and to command us to work from them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 By the ſame reaſon, that the Antinomians forbid a Chriſtian to repent for pardon, and to work for ſalvation, they may forbid him likewiſe to pray for remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to pray for ſalvation; for is not prayer a work, yea, a prime part of a Chriſtians conſtant work ſo long as hee is on earth? And if there be any colour of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing thoſe as Merit-mongers who aſſert, That wee muſt work for ſalvation; there is a like co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for the ſame accuſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe, who ſhall aſſert, That we muſt pray for ſalvation, which I doubt not is the duty of all thoſe who ſhall come to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Some Antinomians ſay, We are not to propound any end at all in doing duty, meaning not baſe and carnal ends, but the higheſt and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:170180:181"/>nobleſt ends; which Doctrine, though intended by them to make us perfect Saints, or to raiſe us to the higheſt pitch of Saints, doth lay us almoſt level with Beaſts, as denuding us of reaſon: for take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the end, which every reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creature, as reaſonable, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds in his actions, and we do <hi>eatenus,</hi> or therein level him with a beaſt; for bruit beaſts do act or move <hi>ad finem,</hi> though not <hi>in finem,</hi> as is the Philoſophical expreſſion; <hi>i. e.</hi> they move and work to ſome end, albeit not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion or ſpecification of an end, <hi>Ad finem eventum, licèt non ad finem intentum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Premiſes conſidered, I hope it will appear paſt all doubt, that a Chriſtian may, and ought to work for his ſalvation. Yea, I think it to be a ſpecial favour for which we who live in times of the New Teſtament are to be very thankful to the Lord, that he hath therein ſo cleerly revealed our own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be that high and great end (not excluding, but therein inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:170180:181"/>the glory of his great Name, as therein moſt eminently conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as was afore ſaid) for which we ought to act and work. And that the mercy and favour of God therein towards us may the better appear, let it bee conſidered at what an uncertainty, not only the Heathen, but many of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Moſes</hi> were, and in what by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes they have erred for want of more full and cleere revelation in that Point, which through the great mercy of God we Chriſtians do now enjoy.</p>
               <p>The Heathen knowing thus much by the light of Nature, that ſome end was to be propoſed unto man in all vertuous actions, they did therefore much beat their brains, and buſie themſelvs to find out what that end muſt be; in the determination whereof it fell out with them, as in moſt of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great inqueſts, ſome thought one thing, and ſome another, ſcarce any among them being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to themſelves, or ſo fixing in ought, as not to fluctuate Some
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:170180:182"/>of them did conceive, that the maine end of their acting ſhould be the hope of another life after this. This indeed was aſſerted by many of their Poets and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; yet not without ſome heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy even in the chiefeſt, <hi>viz.</hi> with a <hi>Fortaſſe,</hi> and a <hi>Non nimium affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maverim.</hi> I have ſeen <hi>Tully,</hi>

Whence it was that ſome of them deviſed a tranſmigration of ſouls, from men into beaſts, and from beaſts into men. And this opinion of theirs being built upon no certain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, others were inclined to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:170180:182"/>That vertue is reward to it ſelf, and that we muſt labour to be vertuous, and to do vertuouſly, only for Vertues ſake; a wiſe man being ſufficiently happy (as they ſaid) when he is tormented in the Bull of <hi>Phalaris.</hi> But others were much unſatisfied in this Opinion, as irrational and abſurd, they ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it for granted, That where dangers, torments and death are, there felicity, eſpecially in the higheſt, cannot conſiſt, unleſſe men ſhould content themſelves with a ſound of empty words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reality. Some of them did therefore place their ſupreme good and utmoſt end in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of ſenſual pleaſures after this life, which divers of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets meant by their fanſie of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſian</hi> fields; and this is the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Mahometans at this day. But this opinion was rejected by many of the wiſeſt and moſt vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous among the Heathens, they thinking that this opinion did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade men into the rank of bruit Creatures, and concluding, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:170180:183"/>that man was born and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Gods for higher things. Thuswe may perceive at what an uncertainty the Heathen were in this point.</p>

Preſuming upon, truſting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and reſting on Chriſt and his Righteouſneſſe for ſalvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any perſonal righteouſneſſe and holineſs in our ſelves, which latter is the common and moſt damning preſumption of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and profane multitude, who though they allow themſelves in known wickedneſſes, yet will reſt upon Chriſt for ſalvation, as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to be ſeen in ſad experience; this being no new thing, but a common thing of old for wicked men in their wickedneſs to leane and to ſtay themſelves upon the Lord, as appears by <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.2. <hi>They did call themſelves of the holy City, and ſtay themſelves upon the God of Iſrael, albeit they did perſiſt in their obſtinacy, their neck being as an iron ſinew, and their brow as braſſe.</hi> ver. 4. See alſo <hi>Micah</hi> 3.11 <hi>The Heads thereof judg for reward, and the Prieſts thereof teach for hire,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:170180:191"/>and the Prophets thereof divine for money, yet will they lean upon the Lord, and ſay, Is not the Lord among us? none evil ſhall come unto us.</hi> And that it ſhall be thus with very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Church to the worlds end, doth ſeem to be a thing as it were foretold by our Saviour, ſaying, Matth. 7.22, 23. <hi>Many will ſay to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have not we propheſied in thy name, and in thy name caſt out divels? Have not we eat and drunk in thy preſence? And then I will profeſſe unto you, I never knew you, depart from me all ye that work iniquity.</hi> The ſin of thoſe Profeſſors was not (as ſome ſuppoſe, alledging that Scripture as a warning whereby to drive people from reſting in their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) that they did make a Chriſt of their duties, and did reſt upon them for ſalvation; but their ſin, (as is evident by the anſwer which Chriſt gives to them) was this, <hi>viz.</hi> That they truſted to Chriſt, and expected that Chriſt ſhould ſave them (they making an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal profeſſion of his name,) in
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:170180:191"/>their profane courſe of life: for could thoſe formal Profeſſors have ſaid to Chriſt as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith;</hi> or could they ſay with that faithful ſervant, <hi>Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds;</hi> or with <hi>Hezekiah, I have walked before thee with a perfect heart.</hi> Chriſt would not have ſaid to them, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me, ye Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, ye Merit-mongers, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſalvation from your own righteouſneſs, and not from mine; but he would have ſaid to them, <hi>Euge, hone ſerve, Well done good and faithful ſervants, enter ye into the joy of your Lord.</hi> But as <hi>David</hi> did truſt God for his bodily ſafety, in ſuch ſort ſhould we truſt in God for our ſouls ſafety and ſalvation, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 44.6. <hi>I will not truſt to my bow, neither ſhall my own ſword ſave me,</hi> ſayes he.

                  </gap> that a bow of ſteel was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by his armes. Even ſo let a Chriſtian ſay, I will not truſt to my own Duties, Works, Graces, Holineſſe, neither ſhall my owne inherent righteouſneſſe ſave me, and yet I will not truſt to be ſaved without them.</p>
               <p>If what I have ſo largely ſpoken in this place be thought by any to be inſufficient, whereby to prevent or wipe off from me the ſaid impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of making good works to be phyſical cauſes of ſalvation, I ſhal wiſh ſuch a one to conſider, That as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> doth ſtile a Saints eternal reward, <hi>the fruit of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and his enjoyment of that reward, <hi>his eating the fruit of thoſe his doings, chap.</hi> 3.10. So the bleſſed Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (that great Preacher of free grace, and Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Chriſts righteouſneſs) doth reſemble good works to ſeed ſown, and ſalvation to the crop or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt. <hi>Gal</hi> 6.8. <hi>He that ſoweth to

               <p>THE next Work which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to my ſelf as a ſecond part of this Tractate concerning the Nature of Forgiveneſs of Sin, is to find out and ſet down thoſe ſeveral phraſes both in the Old and New Teſtament which I take to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſynonimous, commenſurate, or equivalent with forgiveneſſe of ſin, and to deduce from thence ſundry Conſectaries according to the method obſerved in this part.</p>
               <p>But becauſe I am willing to make trial what acceptance this firſt part of my labour will find, before I publiſh a ſecond; and becauſe it may perhaps be long ere my lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:170180:193"/>from my weekly paines in preaching will permit me fully to accompliſh what I intend as a ſupplement hereof; I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuffix unto this firſt Part that which otherwiſe I had reſerved for the cloſe of my whole labour of this kind; <hi>viz.</hi> The following Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatory Apology. or Apologetical conſolation, ſaying:</p>
               <p>If in this preſent undertaking, to diſcover the true and full nature of forgiveneſſe of ſin, I have in ought <hi>[Humanum paſſus,]</hi>

And as for the pardon of man,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:170180:194"/>eſpecially of my fellow ſervants and brethren in the Miniſtryl what ſhall I ſay? Shall I ſay, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe it, and care not much for it? God forbid, let ſuch a ſpirit of pride and diſdain be far and far from me, and not from me only, but from all thoſe who profeſſe themſelves to be diſciples unto that Lord, who hath given both a Precept and a Pattern of Humility unto all his ſervants, inſtructing them hereunto both <hi>Voce &amp; Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tâ,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.</hi> I am therefore reſolved by the helping grace of God, not to ſtick to crave pardon of man as well as of God, according as my need of it, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of asking it ſhall be made appear unto me; and in ſo doing I do not at all doubt, but that I ſhall obtain it, according to that Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, —<hi>Veniam petimuſque da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſque viciſſim.</hi> Even ſo, O thou Preſerver of men, for Chriſt Jeſus his ſake; <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes, as wee forgive them

                  <hi>Chap. 23.</hi> That remiſsion of ſin, [<hi>Quoad terminum remotum</hi> or as in execution;] is a real, yea, phyſical change, and not a change purely relative, as is commonly ſuppoſed. <hi>p 204</hi>

               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 26.</hi> That a Believer du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his warfare on earth is to fear hell and damnation why, and how, proved and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as alſo cleared in the way of anſwer to ſeveral Objections, notwithſtanding the Doctrine of Perſeverance of the Saints be acknowledged; in anſwer to which Objections, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency and co-operation of the love of God, and the fear of God is proved. What man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of fear it is that love doth expel, and what manner of fear it is that love doth retain,
<pb facs="tcp:170180:201"/>declared: Notwithſtanding, that Believers are reſtrained by the love of God, yet that God doth uſe ſeveral other means whereby to conſtraine; <hi>i. e.</hi> effectually to induce them, proved: and what thoſe ſeveral means are, ſpecified more at large. The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency and co-operation of faith and fear, maintained and proved. That filial and ſlaviſh fear do not differ in their object matter, or in the thing feared, but in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of fearing, aſſerted, and how, proved and cleered by a due interpretation of that Scripture in <hi>Luke 1.74.</hi> The difference betwixt fear as it is the fruit of the ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and as a fruit of the Spirit of Adoption, opened and aſſerted. <hi>p. 235</hi>

               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 27</hi> That a Miniſter of the Goſpel hath no warrant ſo to abſolve a Believer, as in the name of God to tell him, That his ſins are as abſolutely pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that he is as abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſure of heaven, as if he were already in heaven. <hi>p. 289</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 28.</hi> That the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which the Goſpel requires, is not only repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <hi>[from]</hi> the pardon of our ſins, as the Antinomians affirm, but <hi>[for]</hi> the pardon of them, proved and evinced by ſeveral Arguments. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Objections of the Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians anſwered; wherein it is punctually declared, In what ſenſe Evangelical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance may be ſaid to be <hi>[from]</hi> pardon of ſin, and in
<pb facs="tcp:170180:202"/>what ſenſe <hi>[for]</hi> the pardon of it. It is diſputable whether Gods glory and our own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are to be looked at as two ends, or only as one; the former being a neceſſary reſult of the latter. An Objection anſwered, That it is a ſingular favour of God, and a favour in ſome ſenſe peculiar to the times of the New Teſtament, that God hath ſo cleerly revealed unto us our eternal ſalvation, (as the great end, not excluding, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding his glory) of mans working, or of all, Chriſtian duty. That good works may be ſtiled the way to ſalvation. That the difference betwixt the Covenant of Works and of Grace lyes not in this, that <hi>Adam</hi> was to work <hi>for</hi> life, and we not <hi>for,</hi> but only <hi>from</hi> life. Our own good works, duties, graces or holineſſe, how
<pb facs="tcp:170180:202"/>far forth, or in what ſenſe to be diſclaimed, and not truſted unto for ſalvation; as alſo in what ſenſe, or how farre forth they may be truſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or reſted in for ſalvation, declared more at large. A Caution annexed to prevent miſtake. That there are two kinds of preſumption, both which are diſtinctly to be made knowne unto people by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be avoided by all, as dangerous rocks in the ſteering of our courſe towards the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of eternal happineſſe. <hi>p. 297</hi>
